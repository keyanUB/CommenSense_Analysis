"My 9 year old son has been playing roblox recently and it is ABSOLOUTLEY disguasting and to the parents out there, never let your children play this game.
",0
"My son is not a terrorist and the creator of this game who is called Badimo wants to get innocent,young children involved in shootings i also saw a chat which had shown slurs and eventually, someone said stuff like 'eww you nine year old suck your mum'  and another one was 'wet donny thinks he can act hard, you wasteman'.
",0
"I was absoloutly disguasted seeing a naked person in what was supposed to be a 'kids game' and yes, sex is a normal thing in life but it is way to inapropriate for kids!
",0
"never let your kids play this game!
",7
"Someone called my son a ""Bacon Newb"" or something and he is crying right now.
",0
"My child was then able to make unauthorised purchases because the site doesn't protect card details by allowing parents to add a password requirement before pressing 'pay now'.
",8
"I took this up with Roblox/Babka who basically didn't give a damn.
",0
"I personally don't think that its for young kids because they can get hacked, my 7 year old got hacked when he bought a lot of roux, don't worry its because he went into a weird game in Roblox.
",0
"Parents NEED to know that there is a VERY dark side to Roblox.
",2
"There are ""condo"" and ""scent"" games that will take the kids to inappropriate servers.
",8
"Kids under 13 are being targeted and invited to these servers as well.
",1
"Sometimes Rape, Gang Rape and Group Sex is present.
",2
"I am horrified that this isn't more moderated.
",0
"The games tend to get taken down but they're like rabbits and then 4 more appear.
",4
"Honestly, if I had known ANY of this was even remotely possible I would have never allowed my daughters to play this game.
",9
"THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE.
",0
"I PLAYED A GAME CALLED EGG FARM SIMULATOR AND THE BOSS WAS 100% HACKING!
",0
"NO CHILD SHOULD EVER HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH SOMETHING THIS HORRIBLE.
",0
"I MIGHT EVEN FILE A LAWSUIT TRYING TO TAKE THIS GAME DOWN.
",0
"Roblox is supposed to be a game for kids.
",6
"Please don't use easy to guess pins because imagine a 5 year old playing really gory games like Euphoria blood testing.
",8
"That's a game where you can rip off body parts and there is violence, bits and gore.
",3
"Of course it's not really too bad but please lock the account and kids under age of 15 can only play 9+.
",4
"If I was 10 and I couldn't play gore kill sim 5 I would be mad.
",3
"This review hopefully will help but I'm not a parent so I am not perfect at it.
",3
"There are games that can be terrifying and scary like Mimic.
",9
"Roblox is game you should keep away from your children.
",7
"A lot of bullying happens and the support team don’t do anything to help.
",6
"Account gets hacked and unauthorised payments are taken and the support team do nothing to help you.
",6
"Honestly keep this game away from your children.
",7
"No good content about this game and your child will be exposed to inappropriate language and content and guess what!
",1
"The support team do nothing to help.
",6
"The platform has become an online hangout for hackers and teens with no life.
",2
"Online bullying is accomplished by circumventing their user agreement (they simple avoid chat, as that's all the platform logs).
",2
"Online bullying is a serious problem and this platform, while claiming to be for children, provides no actual educational value (their programming is proprietary) and is driven by cash profit.
",8
"It started out noble, but like all things, became monetized and corrupted.
",1
"Don't let your kids on this platform.
",7
"This company is letting people use Stolen CREDIT CARDS TO BUY PRODUCTS WITHOUT CHECKING.
",1
"NO WAY TO CONTACT COMPANY TO EVEN STOP THE USE.
",0
"ITS PURE THEFT by this company even if they they double check to make sure there is NO SCAM THEFT.
",7
"This game is bad my duaghter has been constantly getting scammed bullied and falsly reported and banned i would never recommend this game to others and now my duaghter is in here room crying her eyes out.
",0
"Also it is very innapropriate as she tells me she has seen very offensive things
",1
"DONT LET THEM PLAY ADOPT ME ROYALE HIGH OR MEEPCITY THEY ARE SCAMS ALSO DONT LET THEM GET THE STICH FACE OR ONLINE DATE BC THERE ARE A BUNCHA WEIRDOS other than that the game is fine as long as ur child isnt dumb (as my child never fell for these scams) and gives out their password and do free robux things i would add two step and make sure they put in their correct age or make it 13+ as u cant change it if ur under 13
",7
"I am extremely disappointed in the developers of this game, for a game that's supposed to be for children first of all it's not monitored for child predators or scammers and one cannot tell if their child is talking to another child or an adult, and secondly and also just as important the developers of this game is all about money $$$ and more money $$$ it's like $20 worth of game credits can only last a child maybe an hour of playing time only for them to come back asking a parent to buy them more game cre
",7
"These developers cheating little children out of their parents money they need to be ashamed for low life scammers that they are.
",4
"But beware of the chat feature because you may find inappropriate content.
",1
"I recommend not playing this game to much.
",4
"There are some really scary games on Roblox and before you play it, it’s  good to spend some time outside.
",3
"However, the reason why I gave this four stars is because some users take Roblox to the “next” level by making inappropriate stuff.
",2
"The app and the actual website is quite misleading since the app looks a lot more different than the website, but I understand.
",2
"People also get mad over the customer service since they get an automated message saying, “** Important ** We are currently receiving a high volume of tickets at this time.” I mean, come on, it’s just a reminder telling you to wait since there are many tickets and that sort of junk.
",6
"Roblox is very bad I caught my students playing it and they were harassing homeless children and eating a five course meal in front of them and a few of them had roblox kittens whatever the hell that means don’t let you’re children near this game after I took roblox away one of my students threatened me with scissors I teach 9-12 grade
",7
"ROBLOX isn't a good game for your kids or your wallet.
",7
"ROBLOX is a corporate shell of what it used to be, the idea your kids can learn from this game is outdated as their business model went to exploiting your kids.
",7
"The filter creates an unsafe environment as it's easily bypassed and generally censors things that don't need to be while ignoring things that need to be and there's always some sort of sex game.
",1
"There's also games that actively encourage violence or that put pay walls every few steps of the game (no literally, you touch something and it will give you a pop up to ask you to spend money on it.)
",8
"It has a friend request feature and I checked it out and has games that start with bad words!
",9
"This game is full of immature kids acting like teens my son came to me the other day with tears in his eyes saying he got bullied on Roblox this is not acceptable  and the over priced stuff on here give me a freaking break
",0
"in some games there are blood and people can number swear and my 8 year old son is repeating these bad words and most of all people can ask you for your address so dont bother to get this game.
",7
"My son wanted to show me the game but only what I saw that somebody said ugly things to him and when my son wrote ""sure"" he got banned for it.
",0
"Ban reason was Harassment/Bullying did not know that this word is harassing.
",0
"But I saw more disgusting things than this.. there are adult ppl acting as kids and sexting with kids.
",8
"Roblox over the years has been making very dissapointing updates in recent years, their moderation is worse than ever, Roblox forgot what they were now they are a deppressing looking site only made to make money, greed has overcome Roblox, they have forgotten about their community and left it to us to keep Roblox alive, most of the games now either are very underated games that are good but impossible to find and poorly advertized by Roblox or some trash cashgrab game with no game in it, just a bunch of gam
",1
"Roblox has also been forcing players to use their updates such as slowing removing R6 to match their vision and removing classic faces to their cheap copies to make the game more 'realistic' even though the people using them are mostly likely new to the game or a troll trying to be funny, although the game isnt going anywhere yet they are losing the old players.
",7
"Absolutely terrible!!
",0
"People taking advantage of kids!
",8
"Seems like pedo’s play this.
",3
"Telling our child not to tell their parents!
",7
"IS A BIG NO NO!!
",0
"Should be 18+ 
",1
"This is out of hand!
",1
"THIS GAME IS NOT MENT FOR CHILDREN THIS IS TERIBLE.
",0
"TOXIC AND A RIP OFF …
",0
"As with other reports first and foremost Roblox rips kids off and they are untouchable, as a parent I have complained to them about my kids buying Robux (a scam Nigeria would be proud of) and have also complained about my kids being scammed by other roblox players.
",9
"There is not even a government department that gives 2 hoots about complaints put in about Roblox.
",6
"Rather than banning scammers, the woke moderators at Roblox will ban your kids for the most inane, harmless comments.
",2
"This is not surprising as Roblox themselves scam kids out of their hard earned money.
",4
"This game is simply Toxic
",2
"this game is bad for you're kids they have bad moderation if you misspell 1 single word you can get banned and if you're kid randomly finds a weird game or weird people you're kid will be doing stuff they are not supposed to do this is a very bad game to play dont play it

"However my 6 year old, Alexiacondiacous (Alex for short) has spotted some really disgusting material on this beautiful and amazing game, they found these games called ""sussy condos"" where people can gyrate their booties.
",9
"THIS IS HORRIBLE!!
",0
"My 4 year old boy, Mikeyongles, has recently been saying the n word and saying ""I hate my mum!
",0
"Fuck you!""
",0
"I was outraged after finding out hes been messaging a 69 year old man who lives in a parking lot, he taught him these words through playing roblox, I swatted the guy after I found him and he got bam bam shot up.
",0
"One thing I'd like to add is that there are silly boys and girls on this game that scare my children, my 6 year old wouldn't shut up about a character on roadblox that is named ""Rush"" from doors.
",0
"it gave her nightmares and she hasn't stopped shitting herself and wetting the bed.
",0
"I also hate the skibidi toilet games because my four year old runs around the house saying ""brrr skibidi dip dip yes ye"" and I hate it.
",9
"RIP to my 7 year old who got ran over on roadblox.
",0
"I'm clinically depressed now!
",9
"Communist and Facist movements are still in the game #winenight #freeourchildrenfromroadbloxcommunism
",2
"I am done with Rōblox.
",9
"I cannot believe this rn.
",5
"You know better then that!
",7
"Bring them back or else I will sue you.
",7
"🤬🤬🤬
",0
"P.S.
",0
": Don't play this fucking game.
",7
"Damn Roblox.
",0
"So many terrorists, 9/11 happened.
",1
"The pentagon got blown up, and the world trade centre got bombed.
",4
"Roblox has alot to do alot to teach in terms of programming but unfortunately the game is full of groomers, discord has quite a few places that encourages anti furry hate to a extreme thet bully and allow cheaters to ruin the game in all ages and 10+ servers.
",2
"When I saw this I became absolutely fuming!
",0
"Why is there games involving sex in Roblox what 7 year old and below can access!
",1
"I recommend that you only play this game if you are 18+ as it has very sexual content and it reminds me of Grand Theft Auto.
",7
"1 star out of 5, DO NOT PLAY!
",6
"bad, bandi say bad, go die
",7
"Unfortunately it's extremely easy to be scammed by them, we do not recommended to buy gift cards, you will lose your money.
",6
"There's no support or customer service, they will shamelessly take your money and not provide the service, in short, they're scammers.
",5
"Do losers have nothing better to do then do that on a kids game?
",5
"I've been playing roblox since I was 9 roblox was slightly disgusting than with people and now its even more fucking disgusting as I'm older and especially with voice chat.
",1
"on top of that people will get you banned for 0 reason and roblox doesn't respond at least this has happened for me.
",6
"I even show them proof as if they would fucking care to look.
",7
"the game has become trash in that aspect and games nowadays are getting more boring.
",1
"It's really getting worthless to play this game anymore.
",3
"I'm 18 now and a lot of people on roblox is not safe for children even when I was little but now its worse.
",2
"Some people be talking shit like sex and etc without getting banned this is how bad it is in my view.
",2
"I would like to rant more but this is some.
",6
"Just recently this game added voice chat, and the moderation for it couldn’t be worse.
",1
"Random people can randomly report your voice chat for Roblox’s robots to ban your ability to use voice chat and there is no moderation for you to reach out to have it appealed.
",1
"This game has no educational value, I’ve only really encountered competitive children on here or racist keyboard warriors.
",4
"Really not a game worth your time, roblox couldn’t care less about their moderation or any weird behavior that’s actually happing on here, and would rather employ robots to do their work than  humans capable of doing a good job.
",9
"Despiciable!
",0
"This game is horrible for children, for starters.
",6
"This game never moderates their games!
",7
"I saw a game with innaprotiate content, They also have hundreds of copyrighted items on their catalog, They also take 70% of a game developers cut of revenue when creating roblox games!
",9
"there is also many horror games kids should not be playing!
",3
"They also disabled my son's account, and when I tried to talk to support about it, they never responded, my child has been crying day and night cause of his roblox account and no matter what I do, I can't get him to smile.
",0
"This is a horrible game and doesn't deserve the popularity it has, Many games also have gambling in them with robux, a currency that costs REAL life dollars!
",2
"This is a horrible game and deserves to be canceled!
",8
"Roblox takes advantage of it's users and developers.
",2
"Their entire platform is built on the backs of international child labor, that is not an exaggeration.
",6
"They don't respect their players or those who generate their revenue.
",5
"There have been multiple accounts, of which you can readily watch documentation of on YouTube, of people coaxing children off-platform into communication sites like Discord to groom them, and they refuse to take responsibility for that, despite that these people are actively playing alongside your children in-game and CAN be identified through their Discord user id I know because I've been a part of a group that traced a scammer back to their Roblox username.
",9
"They know VERY well that what they're doing is malicious and have refused to do anything about it for years.
",0
"They are greedy, and have successfully created a vacuum for the wealthy to thrive.
",1
"Because on top of charging you 75% of your total revenue, they also charge you for advertising on their platform.
",6
"Unreal.
",0
"The executives at Roblox need to be put in jail, but taking advantage of children is just kinda part of our entire economic system, so justice will probably never be served, and they'll never see how wrong their actions are through the money their making profiting from their greed.
",9
"I dislike how Roblox can be toxic for kids, and Roblox doesn't ban people even if they scam, or bully.
",2
"Sure they ban some people, but some people get away with it.
",1
"Horrible and traumatizing game.
",2
"Horrific for adults to see their kids learn this stuff at a young age.
",4
"Roblox willingly allows users to engage in extremely abusive monetisation techniques.
",1
"At its best, it is filled with greedy developers who demand premium currency in exchange for almost anything in game.
",6
"At its worst, it is filled with outright scammers - and the developers of the game are among them.
",9
"Our experience is one where the 2-factor authentication on my daughter's account failed and someone was able to log in to her account.
",0
"Roblox then reset the account, including the missing premium currency (around £30 to £40 worth) - but then shortly after that took back the premium currency stating that they were unable to help.
",6
"Clearly as the currency was restored, it's not that they are 'unable' to help - just unwilling.
",6
"No further explanation was given, nor did we receive a response to the question of how someone was able to access the account despite me having 2FA on it.
",0
"It's not the first time we've had issues with this shoddy operation.
",9
"It took far too long to get a resolution to this and we were practically pulling out teeth just to get a positive response from their so called customer services team.
",6
"This ""game"" is nothing more than a scam.
",6
"I would caution parents to encourage their kids stay far away from it.
",3
"I am extremely repulsed to see that the fact in Roblox, my child has been having tantrums because of the game called Mimic, apparently Sama in the mimic is the worse when it gets him, he gets extremely unorthodox about it.
",0
"This is extremely disappointing to hear my child getting extremely mad.
",7
"In Doors, the monsters that are cartoons make my child extremely scared and petrified.
",3
"My child has been having too many tantrums over these, also inappropriate that the entity Sama and Rush has wall hacks and X-Ray that must be nerfed, I will created a full on complaint about the truths of the output this content has received to my child.
",1
"I am disappointed and ashamed of the game named Egg farm simulator and how hacks orientated the space boss is I will be filing a cease and assist due to my fury and anger .
",0
"I also want to go into detail on how time wasting the waiting process to get into the boss I am extremely furious because of these factors do not come up on my home page ever again.
",0
"i mean kids just get this game to have fun but theres only 1 word you are not allowed to say on roblox its b****s i dont know why roblox didnt ban this word and it has s*x and i dont like it and people are rude so i dont recommend this
",2
"i got aids from that game and my final wish is to bust my final nut.
",1
"Not safe.
",0
"The game itself is fine, but the customer service itself and the customer support is a joke.
",6
"You can literally get banned for speaking your own language in the game, because if roblox thinks that some words in your language  sounds or seems the same as an innapropriate word in english, you are censored immedietly and its likely to get banned afterwards.
",1
"Also the customer support takes days to answer for your appeals, and when its about a 1-3 day ban of your account, its annoying to be punished for days while you did not do anything wrong.
",6
"Overall good potential, but ruined by the company.
",1
"this is a good game but it wont let me put my phone number in,
",0
"This game is great and all but the glitches and lag is killing me.
",1
"Like when I'm about to do something in the game I get kicked out to the Roblox loading page.
",6
"It's extremely frustrating.
",3
"ever since this byfron thing came my roblox game always crashes it made me lose a items in a game so roblox fix this
",6
"Roblox is the epitome of greediness.
",5
"They are constantly rising up the cost of the credits ""Robux"" to the point where it became a rip-off.
",1
"Since February, I've stopped buying him gift cards.
",0
"Related to the content now, there is some bullying and foul language taking place so always speak to your child every so often to make sure he's doing OK.
",1
"Overall, I would not recommend introducing the platform to your kids for the reason that the games in there offers no educational content and most of the games are not even competitive and quite a few games are made with the concept of ""Pay to win"", so I really see no value on playing Roblox.
",3
"I see a lot of people saying people can be rude.
",2
"It just depends what game you're playing, you can usually tell by joining if people will be mean by looking at their avatars.
",7
"A game that you should stay away from would be like Da Hood, it's really violent and people are mean.
",4
"Also make sure you're monitoring your kid, a lot of roblox bullies parents aren't even aware they bully kids.
",7
"When she was younger she would always play, but now she is not allowed to play the game.
",0
"I don't think it is a kid-appropriate game.
",2
"Before things started changing the game was perfectly fine but now I am disgusted by how it has changed over time.
",0
"My child was messaging random strangers on Roblox.
",7
"But Overall we reported that person that person got kicked and reported off of roblox.
",0
"For 1 to 6 year old
",4
"Just no don't let them play they are too young
",7
"2.
",0
"This game is VERY BAD for children I sae my sun getting, lets just say, ""women"".
",6
"The worst customer service imaginable, people who have no idea what they are doing and shouldn’t be in that field.
",6
"Fraud and money scams.
",6
"Your child will be exposed to inappropriate content that is not ever moderated appropriately.
",1
"Better to find somewhere else to enjoy your time on the internet.
",6
"Not somewhere that’s going to steal money, never respond and have terrible service, and doesn’t appreciate its consumers.
",8
"The worst service in the face of the planet.
",6
"Everyone associated ought to be ashamed and embarrassed.
",0
"Bad staff I reported 5 Hackers and the past 2 months And they never got warned Or banned and its clear they are using cheats Like, Flying No damage And telaporting without in-game cmds
",6
"Hello I don't think it is a good game for young kids so I think 12+ rating is good
",2
"And their support staff Sam is pretty useless, all he said was pretty much “too bad u can’t do anything about it”
",6
"Roblox is fun for kids but there are some games that are not appropriate are the people in it aren’t like games that bypass the chat filter.
",1
"Sadly you do have to spend robux (an in game currency you have to spend money to get) alright now I’ll talk about the bad things but do not worry most of the topics in the bad section I talk about is very uncommon to witness.
",6
"Also people can sometimes be rude,  while most of the people on roblox are nice, some people are rude.
",1
"I have encountered someone who gave me a death threat cause I didn’t give them something.
",5
"So for the romance I have a lot to say, most games have no romance people in it can be innopropiate games like meepcity (you shouldn’t join that one) are made for kids the people in it can be innopropiate it’s very common for meepcity to have romance and dating in it even though it isn’t supposed to.
",8
"And some games on roblox allow romance so all I am saying is try to avoid meepcity or any romantic games if you dislike romance.
",8
"For the violence  there isn’t much but games like arsenal and combat warriors are based around violence so if you don’t like violence then avoid playing games like that.
",3
"My son whose only 6 watches koneto kitten and kreekcraft throughout his day, After viewing both youtubers videos i have noticed kreekcraft talking about hot moms which to me is absolutely disgusting and koneto for cursing in his documentary videos.

"I as a mother of 8 decided to tell them off and report them.

"My son will never be playing Da Hood again until the developer adds in a child mode.

"I recommend banning people that bully evidently in the chat.

"There’s no need for rage or hate in servers.

"If your kid can handle being called a “noob” (this is a word the kids use to make fun of each other on the app, basically calling them a new player) or if they can handle being called stinky then they will be fine.
",7
"If your child last account is rated above 13, they might be called dumb, but that’s about it.
",7
"Expect a little bit of bad language.
",2
"I really do think some parents are very over dramatic about Roblox, most of those parents let their 5 year old play without any restrictions and the child plays police officer role play games and sees their character die.
",4
"It’s a much better alternative then Fortnite or Minecraft where you can chat freely and use voice chat, which leads to much worse then a little bit of childish fights.
",1
"Every game single game these days has complaints from parents about safety, well that’s the internet.
",2
"There are way too many violence and innapropaiate games even in the front page, and Roblox is 10+.
",8
"There are fps games with blood and injury detail, which Roblox pretends to not notice.
",1
"I see a lot of people who harrass people by gender and hating on LGBT.
",9
"It's really unacceptable.
",2
"There are games which refrence crime like Jailbreak, and games featuring Squid Game, which is obviously not suitable either.
",8
"That only scratches the surface of why Roblox is not safe enough.
",4
"In some games there are some stabbing/killing and very mild blood but it’s all cartoonish so nothing gets to over the top.
",3
"As for language there’s mild name calling (« Stupid » « ass ») but no real swear words because ROBLOX blocks it.
",1
"There’s tons of consumerism as in each game you log in there’s a box that pops up to buy robux.
",8
"They can easily get hacked.
",7
"Roblox only cares about money.
",0
"When I tried requesting for a refund because I decided that I didn't want the Robux that I just bought, my account immediately got banned.

"She's a psycho don't dowload

"There are games with guns that we don’t play because we don’t want our daughter to think of guns as fun.

"But this week, they ventured into some roblox games, which really traumatized them.

"We missed scrolling down and seeing the scary label too.
",2
"Half way into a seemingly kids friendly game, my boy had a kidnapper grab him and killed him.

"He started sobbing hysterically after he was killed in the game.

"It was as though he was living through a real kidnapping.

"He told me that he ran and hid, but there was no escape .

"I realized there is a satanic element in some of the games.
",2
"My daughter was crying before bed time tonight and it’s her turn to be traumatized by a roblox game.
",0
"She said she was fearful of a roblox character.
",0
"Danger lurks when they start playing that next game.
",0
"Roblox does not prioritize kids' safety.
",4
"They took down their on-site forums so now kids have to go off site to coordinate with each other to make successful games.
",8
"And how they say ‘Not safe for children!’ Well they are to a certain extent right but also wrong.
",1
"And they are strict on there censorship system.
",1
"There are a few dangers.
",3
"Games on it (especially for mobile users) can be either low quality or laggy or buggy as a result of your device going into an overload.
",4
"But there are Toxic people in this game nowadays and the moderation is bad.
",1
"i think the game is really not so good and its should be 18+ because the kids eats plastic and its not ECO so the game shozld get banned
",3
"She had lots of pets and got given roblox money for her birthday but they cancelled her account and gave us no explanation and she lost everything.

"Lots of people are unhappy about this but I understand.
",5
"Next time just do like 1 million people at a time because now when roblox is back up it might crash again when 48.1 million people are logging in!
",0
"I think that Roblox is a horrible game because of how many technical difficulties they have with their servers.
",0
"They are always down or having issues to the point where you can not join any games for long periods of time.
",9
"The games themselves are very slow and people within the games promote so much violence it is harmful to the innocent children that are on this platform.
",1
"Many of the players bully other players and have inappropriate usernames that promote unspeakable things.
",8
"For a community that’s supposed to be mostly under 16, these people are surprisingly toxic.
",8
"I join servers to bully bullies, think about it Mark!
",3
"Sure it could be worse somehow (although I'm sure that would lead to a lawsuit) but it’s also super scary the amount of kids under 13 I’ve been around who say some fiendish stuff.
",8
"Hey hey it’s your kid but im a whole adult and I feel very uncomfortable (THROUGH A SCREEN) sometimes

"Roblox is bad because they wont let appeal account deleted open my account .
",5
"kid can swearing and don't matter
",5
"Instead of being safe while playing Adopt Me I have been picked up by someone posing as a child and taken to their private house location.
",8
"There are multiple games on the Roblox platform that take advantage of children.
",8
"They make it difficult for the children to convert what they are actually spending to real dollars because they are not skilled at math and the robux values do not equate to real dollars.
",4
"The reporting system is weak and the moderators are useless to nonexistent.
",2
"I’ve reported people for harassment and included screenshots  and the reports go nowhere and the harassment continues.
",1
"If you complain for yourself or child it is just as likely you would be the one penalized so they do not get bad press.
",7
"I have no idea how Roblox considers this okay.
",7
"My daughters friend plays it and I won’t allow mine in that game or Adopt Me.
",0
"They are full of adult pedophiles.
",8
"I do not see the point in having this as an option to 13 yr olds if they are not trying to sexualize them for profit.
",4
"Also, the private message system allows children to have “cyber sex” and I was in a panic one day when two people were talking about going “private” to do that and I was just glad to close the program quickly.
",0
"The private message system cannot be monitored.
",5
"They also get around the chat filter all the time for swearing, bullying and sexual behavior by using numbers and spaces in the words.
",1
"This is not a healthy environment.
",8
"The game is ok my son said his friends played it but then he came to me and said “the game said it was for kids around the age of 6 and up it looks like a 2 year old lego game.” I checked it out and the moderation was bad.

"So  just don’t let your kids play this.

"The community is toxic and also the company manipulates many young kids by saying they can make a roblox game and become successful but you have to put hundreds of dollar into advertising your game.

"The damn game is full of rude people.

"dont make a game on roblox its dumb
",4
"my opinion on Roblox is it can most definitely be better like adding voice chat and their reporting for example if I report someone on Roblox for bullying me and causing all they say is ""we will take a look"" and they never do that is why I never report ppl it is a 1-1000000 chance of them doing something about it and if I report someone for hacking cursing and bullying personal question and ext nothing happens there is a guy out there witch some of you maybe know about he is a scammer he got banned for 2 da

"Sending phone numbers, Sharing snapchats, Sending suicide threats, rape threats, where they live, who they live with, how old they are, online dating, getting a ""boy/girlfriend"", sharing inappropriate images to get an item in a game on Roblox, sharing account details, emails.

"It's not as safe as it may seem, if you've been playing long enough, know enough games, there's nothing child-friendly about it.

"And that Roblox’s moderation is not really that neat and offensive or rude phrases, slurs or cuss words can be bypassed by replacing some letters with numbers or symbols, or with another letter that would make the word sound the same as it’s original way of being spelled.
",1
"Inappropriate sentences, phrases or words can be sensored with the “#” symbol.
",8
"Another thing i heard is that scam bots, or roblox accounts that are made for spamming can post links onto comment sections of items or into chats.

"And those links can lead to scam sites or websites that can grab your personal information.

"These ads can trick players, especially small children, into clicking links and possibly falling for scams or getting personal info stolen.

"Violence - Not only that there are guns available, but that other kids of all ages can, and do, bully children by coming to their homes, forcing themselves in, ""killing"" their characters in home invasions, stealing from them, attacking them while on the road and taking their cars, etc.

"While this may not seem like a big deal to adults, this can be to young children who are bombarded by groups of kids who come in gangs to their homes.

"There are also games in the roblox community specially formatted for the LBGTQ communities, etc and also very violent games.

"These games are NOT age rated in any way.

"Clothing - There is some clothing which may not seem appropriate for young children.

"Bullying - While I addressed this briefly in #1, violence, it's important to note that this also happens among other children bullying each other (girls - girls, etc).

",8
"Below is my lengthy explanation on how Roblox works...
",6
"
",0
"Roblox is NOT a game.
",2
"Unfortunately, the only way to create a game is to do it on a PC, because the game creator ""Roblox Studio"" is a bit too much for mobile devices.
",6
"All the games on Roblox are made by real people, and although Roblox tries hard to moderate their platform, there will obviously be some dodgy games made by some dodgy people.
",2
"Of course, Roblox can't prevent this as most of the games on the platform are created by others.
",1
"Parent should be aware that Roblox has massive buy bait included in it.
",9
"Much like fortnite its aimed at kids that need to impress their friends.
",4
"I was utterly disgusted that a person can create a game so popular and then goes on to seemingly insist on buying in-game upgrades (subtly) in order to proceed.
",8
"I honestly think there is a lot of hook and con going on with this game.
",2
"My kid suffered frustration week on week and had already spent £30 of his pocket money trying to get the only character but didnt get the one he wanted.
",6
"Roblox isnt doing a good job of this at all.
",2
"Its part of a wider problem of baiting kids to spend money on meaningless purchases.
",3
"What makes me sick about this tower defence game is that its popular that is not being regulated and is likely feeding some guy on yacht somewhere.
",6
"Laughing all the way to the bank because of people like me who grant their kids pocket money only to be spent on crap.
",8
"I have banned this game.
",6
"I dont think its morally right that my kid is a constant victim of scams.
",6
"Its just exploitation of children and its massively wrong on so many levels.
",8
"When you approach your child wanting to play this game be aware that it promotes/enforces addictive in-game purchases (as above) and in latest news doesnt have enough controls to prevent some really dark crimes.
",4
"Im very sickened by my childs desire to buy buy buy just to get to level 2.
",9
"Disgusting and Roblux needs to sort this out.
",8
"It has a lot of drugs and all kid shall play and have some slays
",9
"If theres a game that has sexual content just know that its not made by ROBLOX, It is made by the ""Community"" So instead of blaming it on ROBLOX blame it on the community.
",2
"If a player swears at your child or bullies your child just use the report feature.
",7
"ROBLOX does take down games that are not family friendly.
",3
"You're scared that your child will give out personal info.
",5
"Like your child is not going to spam your IP address.
",7
"The worst your child can do is say there name or age, if that's a little too much for you just tell them to not say anything about yourself and just play the game.
",7
"So please, Don't blame ROBLOX.
",3
"one of the best and most safe game out there u might be like roblox aint safe well THEN DONT TALK TO ME lol so its safe u might be concerned for ur  child but con games are impossible to find and roblox takes them away very fast in few hours ur KID WONT FIND A CON GAME UNLESS HIS BEIN SEARCHING HOURS FOR ONE  so just tell them not to and they shouldnt ppl saying bad stuff go to settings and block chat someone bothering u block or ignore them

"I was completely shocked beyond comprehension.

"People my age probably associated this with the terrorist acts we saw on TV, but luckily my child was just frustrated that she had to wait helplessly to see her character get destroyed.

"If your child is viewing iffy stuff on Roblox, you as the parent are to blame, your child would have to know what to search in order to find those games.

"Ok, so there are parents who think roblox is a bad platform, but those are just fucking bitches who don't know about parental control features, you can turn off the chat, you can put a pin so your child can't change the controls, I don't know what is wrong with adults these days.

"Many people also swear and try to get other peoples passwords!

"I do not recommend this game!

"In Roblox people find ways to swear and say other words that’s why I recommend for the children to have it at their age.
",1
"For those who say that Roblox is way to violent, roblox just has games that are like that, that are mean for older kids no for kids in the range if 5-10 but they are any older than that age they should be allowed to play it because they will know it’s a game with that purpose.

"But you have to be careful,  or you see things like: ""abc for a gf/bf"", ""####(hashtags)"", ""lol you are dumb"", you have to report these people.

"If your child says, ""I see a bully,"" in game there are two options.

"If your kids do come across a bully or exploiter, you can simply disable their chat or set their chat so that they can only talk to their trusted friends.
",7
"Another complaint I see a lot in the reviews is that there are a lot of online daters in Roblox.
",2
"If you catch your kids doing inappropriate things online such as dating, that means you're being an irresponsible parent and not keeping track of the games your child is playing.

"There are more complaints on a game called Jailbreak, which is often compared to GTA 5 in the reviews.

"I saw everything with my eyes so if your a parent don’t let your kids play this game or your going have a kid learning sexual stuff in that game or swear words  or screaming so this is a fact not a lie.

"Next here’s some downsides.
",1
"First players can do strange thing.
",2
"For example If your kid play Work At A Pizza Place then players can ask you to quit as manager to get the job then report you for “Bullying”, Or if you play Adopt Me then people roleplay as boy friends and girlfriends report them.

"Next the chat filter makes it hard to speak if you set your age under 13.

"One of the main issues is with the company and it's handling of those who violate their guidelines/rules.
",1
"There are many groups that openly bully and admit it yet still are in the games and play often.
",8
"There are hackers and scammers too that can stay and are only banned from certain games.
",8
"The game does an ok job of concealing bad language with hashtags over the offensive words however there are ways to get around this.
",1
"Make sure you READ all the policies there are many and several circle around to the companies benefit with no recourse but appeal which is usually denied.
",5
"I've witnessed several bullying situations with my child, her friends and others in the game.
",0
"There have been comments and actions that are not appropriate for kids at all.
",4
"This will only “buy” certain things.
",5
"Roblox itself is a good game but of course its the players that make it not kid friendly at all.
",3
"First off Roblox has a strict chat filter and it censors out a lot of words but there are so many ways to get around this.
",1
"Ill give some examples of the stuff I saw when playing this game that I can remember off the top of my head: Someone telling kids to go to a website called ""rule 34"" which is basically known for the most disturbing and disgusting videos on the internet.
",8
"Ive seen people get into fights in the chat and and one player says ""yourgirlfriendhasthesmallesttiddiesever"" and another goes on to say stuff about ""your mom has cow tits"" ect.
",0
"I always report these kinds of people but Roblox's moderation is AWFUL.
",2
"Next thing is the thing I hate most.
",2
"ALOT of people bypass Roblox's audio moderation and will play inappropriate music with swearing and inappropriate themes.
",1
"Someone had a radio and started playing a bunch of inappropriate songs like ""Dicks in my butt, shes such a slut I nut.., I fuck your mother she.. And very loud female moaning noises.
",0
"Developers only really put these in their games so they can make money off of people buying it but if Roblox isnt going to have a good moderation team then I think they should not allow this.
",7
"I dont know how blatant screaming moaning noises went through their moderation team.
",6
"Roblox has the worst moderation ive ever seen.
",6
"I know Roblox likes to say that everything on their website goes through a moderation team but thats either a lie or the people on their moderation team are lazy and just accept anything without looking at them.
",2
"So many inappropriate audios are uploaded to their website and used.
",6
"There are inappropriate games.
",1
"There are inappropriate games that can do anything from pose characters in sexual ways, animate the players characters to simulate sex acts ect.
",7
"Ive never been in one of these games and they do not show up on the front or home page, you would have to search for them or know what to search for to get to them.
",7
"But I have seen other weird or disgusting ones with a thumbnail of a woman Roblox character farting or shitting ect.
",8
"Roblox is a bit better with banning peoples accounts for making these and taking down the games than they are at moderating the audios.
",2
"They really need better moderation, the game makes so much money yet cant afford a better moderation system considering they are soon to be adding ingame voice chat and videos which I think is a horrible idea considering what happens with the audios.
",1
"Ive also seen just disgusting games show up on the front page like ""Eat poop simulator"" ""Pick a toilet"" and more poop/fart themes.
",0
"Like I said before when I see people talking about inappropriate things I report them but when I check on their account days later theyre not banned.
",0
"When reporting someone Roblox says they will review the ingame chats and if they find anything they will take action but I believe they do not do this at all.
",7
"Another point I wanted to make is about ""Online Dating"" Roblox is against online dating and doesnt let you say ""I love you' or anything like that in the chat.
",5
"But im sure this is a problem on any social platform.
",2
"The thing im more concerned about is the sex stuff that happens and it does.
",1
"As for violence there are shooter and killing games but theyre not graphic as Roblox forbids blood or anything graphically violent.
",3
"There is a lot of scamming and different ways to scam.
",1
"There are a few ways this scam works but basically I would tell kids to not gift their pets to anyone or they will get scammed.
",7
"My problem with this game is it is very consumerism like.
",8
"There are so many things in this game that cost real life money and most people who play this game end up spending real life money on it because all of the ""good"" or popular stuff you need to buy with real life money.

"I think its impossible to give away phone numbers and addresses.

"Are the games even good?

"1.
",0
"ROBLOX IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE >:(
",0
"I have to admit, prior to the pandemic, I had never, personally, spent time researching  the games in Roblox, but instead allowed the  ""naysayers"" to  influence my decision not to allow my 8 y.o.
",9
"In fact,  as a general  rule, I avoided ""screens"" like the plague and had never so much as  talked to my daughter about online ""etiquette"", let alone ""online safety"", i.e.,  how to spot  ""grooming"" behavior, which, as you probably already know, is a term used to refer to  predators who say & do certain things to gain the trust of our kiddos!
",0
"However, that all changed when the pandemic caused our world as we knew it came to a screeching halt this past March,  i.e., no more attending traditional brick & mortar school, playing with  friends, going on vacation,  to summer camps, etc., etc..!!
",0
"However, without  moderation & crystal clear rules, that same technology went from a ""curse to a blessing"" will quickly return to a curse.
",6
"So yes people swear and say certain inappropriate things, but if u turn off chat it is very difficult to find inappropriate things.
",1
"The only way if ur chat is disabled is by joining an inappropriate game your “friend” is playing.
",1
"Bc it is very hard to find inappropriate games.
",1
"There also are killing games, however u can just check ur kids recently played if u dint want them playing these.
",7
"U can buy “premiuM” the in game currency (used to be called robux and there are hackers.
",6
"But its hard if there not on ur friends list.
",7
"The games they like to play aren't educational at all and anyone can make a game and monetize it.
",6
"Many times my kids will be playing a game that has pop-ups for purchases with Robux and my kids have made accidental purchases that are impossible to be refunded.
",0
"I reported it and sent a separate report, but I don't know if the person was investigated at all.
",0
"In the same game, players are constantly scamming eachother out of pets and other items that are purchased with Robux.
",3
"In another game, a player was bullying me after being in the game for just a few minutes.
",0
"I reported that player, too, but the players are often cruel to eachother in chat and I'm sure most parents don't even know they can turn that feature off for their kids.
",3
"This is unacceptable.
",2
"There is no way to protect our kids properly in this game and it needs a huge overhaul to be safe.
",8
"Many games are violent and include players killing eachother with various weapons or monsters chasing them to kill them.
",3
"Albert/flamingo is a youtuber I do not think he wants kids killing their animals and ""sacrificing them to satin.""
",0
"He is doing this as entertainment and a joke.
",4
"Not saying it is funny but, just clarifying that it is a simple joke.
",5
"Roblox does not promote online dating and other S3x related stuff.
",2
"When someone is cursing in the chat just close it or leave the game.

"look there are karens who say this game is horrible but in reality the only bad thing is the chat and sometimes you will have a troller or two but thats it it is really a good game

"As soon as she spent the money, every single thing she had vanished.
",0
"She was absolutely devastated!!!
",0
"I contacted Robux, who said they do not replace anything.
",0
"Now, based on their response, I think they are a scam and they took it all away as soon as we spent money on it, hoping it would force us to re-buy what she lost.
",6
"She couldn't focus on her class or anything else she had to do anymore.
",0
"My child became so argumentative and sassy when we took away her access to her Roblox account.
",6
"Also some of the activities on Roblox are completely time suckers.
",2
"It doesn't do anything but keep the kids mind hypnotized.
",4
"From our experience and what we heard from many friends about their children spending more than one or two hours a day on Roblox doesn't do good but damage to the children.
",6
"We ended up banning our daughter from accessing the site for two weeks.
",0
"My son was a victim of a hack.
",9
"My PayPal account was hacked and the source was Roblox.
",0
"The kids become addicted to this.
",7
"My son, meanwhile, had his Roblox password changed, and session disconnected so he couldn’t change it himself.
",0
"Because we notified them to the account being compromised, Roblox them shut down my son’s account.
",8
"Their response is that,  because of the compromise they will not reopen or discuss  the account any further.
",4
"As well as being a victim of the initial financial crime, my son now has no access to any existing Roblox funds he may still have In his account.
",0
"His Roblox service is terminated with no further redress to whether Roblox should do this or not.
",6
"If you buy your child Robux, your purchasing account is at risk.
",7
"If the child’s Roblox account is hacked, any money that you have spent in the account will also be lost.
",6
"My son is devastated as he has traded up and up, and some items he says are very rare.
",5
"This response from Roblox is victim blaming.
",9
"My son became very emotional having just been denied everything he has built up.
",6
"He is young, and had I been aware I would have not allowed this risk.
",0
"WHY WOULD THIS GAME MAKE TAGS HALF OF EVERYTHING YOU SAY GOES TO TAGS (unless you have safe chat) why is safe chat even a thing half of it is people (OD) online daters taking children’s info with apps such as (snap chat, discord, or iMessage  get your child a android this game SUCKS I RAGE SO MUCH and people are so very mean (cyber bullying) I’ve cried many times bc I’m a cry baby :)
",2
"Not very violent but sometimes there may be toxic language in the chat but it is censored with a hashtag.
",1
"Here is the thing with all these reviews complaining about roblox.
",2
"If your just letting your kids do whatever they want on roblox without talking to them about it then yes they can find some questionable things.
",7
"I don't recommend games like island life or meep city if your under 13.
",5
"Not visa cause i Used visa once and the next day someone in another state got my information and spent my money.
",0
"We have never paid any $ and they have the chat feature turned off so they don't talk to others playing that they don't know in real life.
",7
"As long as public chat is turned off, kids are told that no money will be spent, and parents monitor which games kids choose to play (letting them know if they're not allowed on any with guns, etc.)
",7
"My daughter played this game when she was 10 until she was 12 then decides she was to old for it.
",0
"At first I thought the idea was scary but my daughter begged.
",0
"So I did some research and found parents complaining about online dating and sex rooms.
",2
"I did not know that these sicks can reach out to him on his cell phone while he thinks he playing with animals this sicko on the other side not so much very inappropriate wording he is no longer able to play the game, it is not good for children at all and put them in situation they are no equipped to understand.
",0
"Roblox is like Steam,Steam is an app where you play other games that other people make and big companies Roblox is like Steam you can play other games and make your own A lot of people hate Roblox because they think is all about playing little kids games,no your wrong not every game on Roblox is for kids get a life and test the full site and games before ready.
",3
"My kids get bullied inside the app ALL DAY LONG!
",2
"Pay to win app that just wants to suck all your money!
",7
"Keep your kids away from this toxic app AND it's community!
",4
"There is games like plugwalks or scented con which have sexual content but the games get deleted very fast.
",3
"If your son sees naked lego characters tell him to leave the game and report it.
",0
"So, you parents who think that Roblox's main theme is violence, one word to describe you, 'Karen' but their customer service is bad.
",6
"I agree I agree ok. but some of you, I suspect you aren't even parents ok. because I see that some of you can't even spell.
",2
"I read this site before I let my kids play it.
",7
"I’m really sick thinking about all the other innocent kids in there without their parents not seeing what I saw to intervene.
",7
"I’m not sure if young kids read these reviews so I don’t want to say too much but let’s just say it was X rated.
",7
"It may not know how to hashtags out descriptions of bad things without using bad words.
",1
"Immediately after all those disgusting drawings someone else had their turn and drew a sweet little teddy bear.

"Probably another innocent 7 yo like my little girl.

"Makes me sick.

"They will only eject him from Roblox if there are multiple reports.

"I recommend 3+ because 1 and 2 year olds might not be able to control the character or customise anything (If I offend your child very sorry).
",4
"I would have gone to jail for hurting him .

"We have deleted all Roblox .
",6
"This wall is full of crazy parents who don't even bother to look at the game.
",2
"The things said by these ""Adults"" are downright unforgivable.
",8
"UNFORGIVABLE.
",0
"I'm genuinely angry by the things said in the adult's section.
",3
"People complain about the shooting games and horror games on the platform but, Roblox has a setting that can stop your child from playing games like that.

"Also, if you don't want people communicating with your child then you can remove the option to chat in game.

"""Parents dosent know anything about the internet""

"Also you need to report to get others banned,because roblox wont look though the chat then.
",5
"if you think that some roblox games are ""demon games(lol)"" then just tell your kids to not play it!

"i thought this web supposed to be common sense??

"the kids all swear too :/

"If someone is sending you bad things, disable chat in settings or block the user.

"Educate your children about scams online.

"If someone is breaking the Roblox TOS(Terms of Service) do not attack roblox or private message them on facebook or something, avoid the person or report them.

"An absolutely horrible game, after only 3 weeks of playing this game my child was having extreme Tantrums that resulted in her having to be taken do the mental health ward.
",0
"I explained to them she's been playing Roblox and not only did the nurse but the unit social worker we're aware of Roblox and said this is the worst game they have ever seen for children.
",0
"Any parents that say this is a good game for children are completely naive and I suggest you guys Google and read other reviews .this game is extremely sexually explicit and not only is it sexual it is a open chat room.
",2
"I had all the parental control settings set among allowing my child to register and that did not even help her safety whatsoever.
",7
"I absolutely HATE this game and I wish I could actually put the harm it does to children on the creator.
",6
"DO NOT ALLOW YOUR CHILDREN TO PLAY ROBLOX EVER!!
",0
"and to top it off, I asked the admin of the game to remove her account and explained the reasons why & he was stating his concern for her loss of achievements if I were to remove her profile.
",0
"So you can't even delete their profile you have to ask permission , which ultimately shows their level of concern
",3
"My kid played this without my permission and now he is scared of props pig for some reason.
",0
"I checked his account and saw he was messaging online people he didn’t know, and even worse, some were wearing bikinis!
",0
"This is not suitable for young children.
",4
"Against all odds that it is too bad, like some idiots in my social class think that I won't waste a single dollar on another game can eat their hats.
",2
"Roblox is NOT a game, but a game engine.
",2
"Roblox allows fraudulent content to scam children of their money and then denies all responsibility.
",2
"She never received it and was very upset.
",9
"I reported the content and emailed Roblox asking for a refund.
",0
"I sent the developer of Adopt me games a screenshot of her purchase and the game developer told me the content my daughter bought from a fraudulent developer and to report it to Roblox and ask them for a refund.
",0
"I opened a second ticket with screen shoots of developer of Adopt me games response and of the item/seller in which Roblux customer support did nothing.
",0
"A third ticket was opened when the store and the seller was deleted and Roblox told us to ""contact the developer"" and hid behind their terms of service.
",0
"But there are also innapropriate and scam games.
",1
"but roblox is constantly deleting those!
",6
"I saw my son playing a game named murder mystery 2 none sense of knife skins and big epik voilence and i throw all his electronics out of the roof top and never to be seen again

"THIS TRSAH NO KISDS SHPOULD PLAY NO GOOD.
",0
"NOEW HE DOESNT REMEmBER NAME.
",0
"I WILL SUE THIS HORRBILE THINGON DEVICE THAT IS ALSO HORRIBLAY.
",0
"But these are filled with trollers.
",3
"Another game to avoid is Bloxburg.
",7
"It is tiring to get in game currency, and I about a year ago spent 100+ real dollars on it.
",6
"I personally am not a fan, but it is aimed to younger players.
",4
"Games to avoid are ones that say free robux.
",8
"This game is atrocious twice now we have put money into my daughter's account and then she gets locked out.
",0
"We put in her username/password and it claims ""username/password invalid"" after the first time we just assumed okay maybe it was just a hacker let's create a new username and more difficult password.
",0
"The second time we put money on her account as she asked for for her birthday for the same exact thing to happen not even 12 hours after money was put into her account when we clicked forgot password they never send an email with any information about password reset like they should.

"We are furious and have reached out to the company multiple times with no response.

"Please parents don't waste your money on this, it's not worth it.
",6
"I just watched a video of Confederate flags allowed on the game...a lynching area for black purple with a black man hanging...players walking around in kkk outfits...are you serious?
",7
"Roblox is a dangerous platform for ANYONE especially kids.
",2
"They can steal sensitive information and gain access to everything stored on your phone and computer.
",5
"It’s extremely scary.
",3
"These people DO hack children.
",1
"My child’s device was compromised.
",0
"They are moderators of the game and sadly some of your kids’ favorite you tubers are associated with them.
",2
"I do NOT recommend this app to ANYONE at any age.
",4
"If you see a YouTuber, “creator”, minigame, etc., focusing around anime it’s best to stay away.
",1
"With vile imagery not suitable for children.
",4
"You never know if you’re clicking into a game that’s innocent or designed to exploit.
",9
"Let any child play this game
",7
"The games that kids play on this platform are fraught with scams and cheats and Roblox continues to take no responsibility for their action sayin, ""reach out to the developer"".
",6
"When Roblox takes the parents money for Robux and kids (my daughter is 9) who use them gets scammed, that is Roblox's responsibility to make sure children are not taken advantage of.
",7
"They hide behind their ""terms of use"" which states that we agree not to take them to court when we purchase the Robux.
",8
"Let it be known that Roblox allows this kind of behavior and will not remedy anything.
",1
"We had some extra payments that we did not recognise, over and above the £40 we had spent.
",6
"When I queried the payments they just deleted the account with no conversation.
",6
"There is no number to call.
",5
"Do not use this system.
",4
"For those who think Roblox is okay for their kids, maybe you should SIT AND WATCH the game and how they text each other.
",7
"IDK about you all, but I don't think that's cute nor appropriate to let a CHILD play.
",3
"Don't let your child to bad stuff.
",7
"Quite disappointing.
",0
"However the worst incident thus far is a girl asking to have s*x with my NINE YEAR OLD SON, and my daughter playing""Bloxton Hotels"" when some creepy Roblox guy appeared in her shower.
",0
"The game's currency, ""Robux"" is extremely overpriced as well.
",3
"I would advise against letting your child playing Roblox, but if you do, take the following actions:
",7
"1: Don't buy Robux.
",6
"If your child starts to become more hostile or agressive after playing this game, the game should not be blamed.
",7
"Getting in the way of being a functional human person, thus being an addiction.
",2
"The moderation is not used in the strongest way.
",9
"There is no possible way to get the in game currency for free.
",6
"Be cautious of this, as they are all scams.
",4
"If your child is playing those games and resulting as a hostile human being.
",7
"Its not the game's fault, it's their unhealthy addiction from playing it to much.
",7
"I was reading the reviews and saw a bunch of bad ones with stupid reasons like, this person wasn’t getting out of my car in game, BOI JUST LEAVE THE GAME IF THATS HAPPENING, it’s not really bad as long as you actually act like a parent and review your kids profile every once in a while, and if that’s not enough turn on restricted mode it’s that easy
",7
"roblox isnt really bad but the poeple who play it are bad they think only cuz they have robux that they are kings and they trat the poeple without robux even worse  than worms and more than half of the roblox players are hackers or bullies and some poeple are being annoying to poeple on purpose even if they know the other one doesnt like it
",6
"So my son has been playing this and it there was not anything I was worried about until recently when some of the games were getting darker and another game on here that’s like a shooting game death match type but the players have on boom boxes on their back that bump some ghetto foul/explicit songs.
",0
"This ain’t radio edited stuff, this is blaring loud and annoying.
",1
"How does the music like this get on this game like that??
",3
"Those are the type of parents that don’t bother to investigate the website before they write this it’s almost like they would let there child play anything to later then say “this game is very violent and gory” which to be honest is a bunch of crap.
",3
"The chat is sometimes innapropriate, but GET REAL, this is what it is like in the real world.
",1
"I don't recommend playing if you are sensitive to swearing, drinking/drugs, and online dating.
",7
"That is about all that is bad about the game!
",2
"Also sometimes the reviews are fake and/or they have not played many of the good games and have only clicked on the bad ones.
",2
"im tired of people saying the game is bad.
",2
"if you ever encounter a bully, theyre just some little kids taking their rage out on you.
",5
"just block them
",7
"worried about the chat feature?
",7
"How many kids accounts have been hacked?
",8
"All spending their spending money on the game every week and no contact information for support except a message board and “we’ll get back to you”!!!!
",6
"Shocking game
",0
"It’s bad for young kids and will force them to buy things there is games I don’t let them play like arsenal which is highly inappropriate with guns and violence and on some games there are scammers that are way to young to play the game like 8 or 9 year olds
",3
"Purchases sometimes glitch out and don't give you the product.
",1
"Roblox will give lots of false excuses as to why this happens.
",1
"But no offer for refund after many useless interactions with them.
",6
"You'll pretty much give up and cut your losses.
",7
"I'm done.
",0
"If anything only order small so they can't steal too much.
",7
"After I did that, my son no longer wanted to play because ""all those games are stupid and for babies!
",0
"I can't even get to any good games!""
",4
"Recently, our son (now age 11) said he got banned from his favorite game and that an admin did it ""for no reason.""
",0
"He was SUPER angry and huffed about for days.
",0
"All was well for a while, but then he got banned again and again, said he had done nothing wrong.
",0
"He had also pepper sprayed another officer but told us he couldn't tell it was an officer because he was not in uniform and driving an unmarked car.
",0
"My son got very angry and then started telling us all about how he wrote to the moderator and threatened that if they didn't reinstate him, he was going to ""get the whole game shut down.""
",0
"Finally, I suggested that since there seemed to be so little control over getting banned, the game wasn't worth his trouble and he needed to find a different game.
",0
"We are now blocking Roblox on all his devices for a while until he can prove he can play the games appropriately and respect other players and any time and content limits we create.
",0
"This is too bad, because in Roblox Studio, our son was creating movie scenes and rock concert stage set-ups and generally being creative.
",1
"But a lot of the games are modeled after GTA where you can hurt others and engage in inappropriate conduct.
",4
"Other players are going to do things that upset your kid, inappropriate things, ignoring, bullying, etc.
",5
"and if your kid is sensitive to these things or gets angry easily, Roblox is not going to go well for them.
",7
"And be prepared for angry protesting when you try to limit the game content or screen time...
",7
"And it's very easy to tell that you guys took one look at it and decided to write a scathing, lying review.
",6
"Do not blame Roblox for the games YOUR CHILD decided to play.
",5
"If your child plays a game and you don't like it, don't let them play it.
",7
"Don't blame Roblox for a violent game.
",3
"Do not blame Roblox for players that are rude.
",3
"THEY'RE the people
",1
"that should be reported.
",7
"And don't say people curse with numbers because they block numbers too.
",1
"Roblox does NOT ask for money.
",7
"So simply don't let them play them!!
",7
"Yes, there are bullies on Roblox.
",2
"But there's a little something called LEAVING THE GAME or BLOCKING THE PLAYER that you could do instead of blaming Roblox.
",7
"Roblox is not an addicting game, my child has never had any problems managing his time on Roblox.
",0
"And if Roblox just isn't the game for your child, DONT BLAME ROBLOX FOR THE FACT THAT YOUR CHILD DOSENT LIKE IT!!!
",7
"If you get scared your child is going to encounter a child predator, dont worry, words such as ""where do you live"" or ""whats your number"" and Numbers themselves all turn into ""###############"" .
",7
"Also, its super rare for something like this to happen, anyway.
",2
"The violence in roblox ISNT EVEN ACTUAL VIOLENCE.
",3
"There is no blood, no gore, just your character falling into pieces like lego characters.
",2
"There are settings you can change for both account safety and account privacy, one of them can restrict your child's ability to use the in-game chat feature, but that defeats half the purpose of roblox, i suggest only using this if your child has a real encounter with a child predator, creepy person, or your child is very young, like 4 or 5 years old.
",5
"CHILD.
",0
"So Roblox isnt to blame for games with cartoon violence or iffy stuff in the slightest.
",3
"Roblox tries very very hard to moderate their content and karens tend to not care.
",2
"It is frustrating to see that all the money that I spent on my son’s account since the beginning, all of it, is gone to the hacker.
",6
"The worst part is there is nothing you can do and nobody cares about it.
",3
"This is something you have to consider, if you buy robux for your kid he will become a target for hackers
",7
"When I considered of allowing my son playing in Roblox, I though about the time he will spend gaming.
",0
"Also, I looked into the bulling and inappropriate content practices.
",2
"So, if your kid is sensitive it may become a problem.
",7
"The real problem is something that is beyond your control.
",8
"Since real money involved in getting robux, there are numerous hacking traps for your kid to fall into.
",7
"There are clever strategies that hackers use to takeover accounts.
",6
"Unfortunately, their response time may exceed several days.
",4
"In my case It has been already close to a week as I watch hacker enjoying my son’s account at my expense.
",0
"I canceled the premium features, but it will take another month, which means that next month, I will pay to hacker again.
",5
"The support feature of Roblox is very sluggish and incompetent.
",9

"Dear Parents, from the creators of some roblox games, if you think roblox is a bad game, you should think outta the box because not all of roblox's games are bad, the ROBLOX Staff did not make the games on the front games, it's actually kids/teens/adults that make these games, based on there imagination and you should see the point because ROBLOX is never cause of your review, its your children/teens that make these games, not roblox.
",7
"ROBLOX motto is ""POWERING IMAGINATION"" and if y'all parents think the youtubers are bad influence to your child.
",2
"ITS not, they are content creators making content for the entertainment of the person watching, making reviews about the game nor the like it or not, so all parents dont blame roblox you must see what your children/teens are doing in the website, once again dont blame roblox.
",2
"I have had my daughter in hysterical tears twice in the last week because her pets were stolen or scammed away from her.
",0
"Research online says this is a common problem.
",2
"Reaching out to the company is unhelpful as you can only post an issue on a board and you get a response that it will be at least 2 weeks until they get back to you.
",5
"Clearly this is an issue which must be addressed, and has not been dealt with yet.
",9
"Even before this issue, I was worried about this game as its sole purpose is to trade with other people -- meaning you are constantly involved with other, unknowns online.
",6
"I had told myself that as all you were doing was trading animals, and not sharing information, that might be ok -- but it turned out it was not.
",0
"Which, while something that is not inherently a problem in an app, does put a parent in a situation of having to monitor and work with their children to decide what kinds of expenditures make sense.
",7
"All in all -- the experience in our household with this app has been disastrous and I would recommend parents stay away.
",2
"Don’t allow your kids to play it.
",7
"Then a couple of days- (not even one week,) go by, I’m getting multiple charges.
",0
"I’ve also messaged Roblox direct to have my son’s account terminated and so wasn’t expecting any other charge.
",0
"On checking my credit card however I’m finding each time he plays the game now, without my approval it’s repurchasing over and over again to almost the tune of a hundred dollars to date.
",0
"And that’s in a matter of days not months.
",6
"From what I’ve just read, other users can scam the kids and basically steal from their account.

"Lost around $100.

"So then I told him to get off but he refuses, I even gave him a new bedtime schdule, but he's still play it.

"For my daughters, they play  roblox games that has too much harassments, so they can get a little fight over things.

"I have been dealing with an issue with my son’s account for over a week.

"I am so angry at customer support!!

"They claim they respond to issues within 24 hours and it’s all a freaking lie!!!

"I hate this game, but my.

"They suck!

"Instead of Roblox freezing the account and resolving the issue they merely deleted her account without any contact or resolution.

"This is not true although there are some game withing the website that may look similiar to call of duty and gta ( short for grand theft auto) it is not anything like it.

"In thoose games there is blood spraying you can beat up people and all that bad stuff.

"There may be other kids saying bad things to your kid but your kid can block them so that they cant contact your kid ever again.

",5
"Sure, there is some violence and innapropriete content, but every game will have that.
",5
"Dont want them playing bad games?
",7
"If they are being bullied, block that player.
",7
"Roblox censors bad and inappropriate words which can be bypassed but still.
",1
"Now Roblox may look innocent, but, some people can find ways to bypass the chat filter and say some pretty bad stuff.
",1
"Some games in there is just too ridiculous, for example ""con sented"" that game contains  too much bad stuff and people get to swear in it.
",1
"Roblox also have those gang games some which mange to bypass the roblox filter  and there is a lot of bad stuff in there.
",1
"There is also robux scams which tricks kids to enter their password and steal their account.
",5
"Sex: In all of my years of playing this game I have never seen anything worse than one idiot saying ""your mom's gay"" but everybody ignored him, and yes I have played the hospital game that CSM was talking about, and I never ran into anything bad.
",0
"Language: actually yes, just about everybody swears and words like ""damn and hell"" aren't censored but everything else is just a bunch of hashtags.
",1
"Illegal things: There are some games out there that focus on being criminals but are nothing more than cops vs. Robbers.
",6
"But a few months later, The game got deleted I tried researching What happened for a while,And It seemed the game had got deleted Due to some sort of hack?
",0
"She was disappointing as There was no point of her having to spend her currency for what?
",0
"So I decided I would email them for a refund, I even had proof of my transactions But they responded with, ""Currently we are not able to refund"" And that's not a very valid response as This game has been around for a long time!

"However, some of these games do involve violence, but it is not at all comparable to GTA5.

"And some people have found ways to type offensive words.

"my only real concern is that your child may stumble upon something you wouldn't want them to see.
",7
"this game jailbreak is not violence.
",3
"The site incites kids to spend money for almost everything, EVEN CHANGING THEIR USERNAME...Outright abusive.
",6
"This business model should be illegal for kids.
",9
"Many parents just like me are likely unaware their kids even created an account with Roblox as there are no safeguards to ensure parents are aware (kids can enter their own e-mail in the parent e-mail field....that is it...unacceptable).
",4
"The games were so addictive to my daughter and peer pressure from her school friends so strong that unfortunately, one day she stole my credit card to be able to pay for Robux...to buy hairs and stuff for her avatar and access some functions....In talking to roblox customer service asking for a refund, this is a situation they experience EVERY SINGLE DAY without doing anything about it.
",0
"My daughter deleted her account - we discussed all the lessons learned for her from this: 1/ Beware of people exploiting other's addictions for money 2/Never join a game /site/app where you must pay to play or win or to change your username and settings 3/Ignore peer pressure 4/Never steal from anyone to satisfy an addiction 5/ denounce abusive sites like this one.

"Okay, so Roblox would be good for 8+ depending on maturity, because this game has some sexual content but I think you should just report and leave it alone.
",2
"They're some people who find cheats to say bad stuff, I would give an example but some kids might be reading.

"A lot of parent don't see the truth.

"But then I saw people cursing so I told him he cant play anymore.
",0
"Just some kids go stealing money from they're parents.
",7
"ROBLOX has many scary games, with horror in violence.
",3
"Some parents catch them playing this, and make them stop.
",7
"One example of a game people hate is ""Murder Mystery 2"".
",2
"It is a game where you have to become a Innocent, Sheriff, or Murderer.
",5
"If you don't like them playing it, just simply tell them that if they play those games, they will get in trouble.
",7
"And if they don't listen, there will be consequences.
",7
"Also, people being sent very horrible images and messages, you can block users on ROBLOX by simple clicking on their profile, clicking the three dots, and finally clicking ""Block user"".
",9
"Also, some people are on the game just to troll.
",2
"So if someone says ""You noob!
",5
""", they could simply mean that you're not that great at the game, because you are new.
",2
"Also, I saw another review saying their son cried after playing a ROBLOX training game.

"Meaning, if you don't do that, your child will get kicked off the game.

"the staff is so heartless.
",6
"I hate this game.
",2
"I think it’s 8+ because when bad stuff is made it gets taken down.The only problem is that kids can be lured onto other sites where they see bad things.Also don’t let your kid play if they would get traumatized by a Peppa Pig horror game or something similar.

"This game has other players that will try and manipulate and bully children.

"Once you report it, no action is taken.

"I have sent multiple emails only to be shrugged off and told it's not their problem.

"No apologies  and no remedies.

"I will be removing this game app from my kids devices.
",4
"But let's all be honest, bullies and swearing can be found everywhere.
",1
"At one point or another your children will get bullied and will learn swears.
",5
"Besides there are parental controls that restrict certain content from roblox.
",1
"Games might promote violence like murder and bots might scam kids for ROBUX and Roblox premium.
",8
"+13 means that the game thinks your child is over 13 and will not filter out much swearing, and safe chat and privacy mode is off.
",1
"Some games on Roblox are bad, like Murder Mystery, Survive The Killer, and Piggy.
",3
"I advise you not let your child play any of those games.
",7
"And the bullying.
",1
"I was watching my son play Bloxburg and someone was bullying him saying that he was a ""noob.""
",0
"I advise you don't let your child play violent games.

"Okay, this game/platform should not have a rating, considering that it is an online game, and those types of games do not have ratings if it is online.

"its so over the top when parents say that their child sent pictures to some weird dude on the internet?

"thats not roblox, and thats slander against the company, for saying that.

"its not okay because you can't expect the companies like YouTube and Roblox to Babysit your kid.

"its not their fault they were exposed to that kind of content, its your fault AS A PARENT to parent your kids.

"its not their fault they were exposed to that content, its yours for nor parenting them.

"There are some very bad games like a game called  ""sented cons"" so they can swear.

"You should know roblox does not make roblox games.
",7
"Here are violent games on roblox and some violent games are popular, The game does not have any sex in it and if it does roblox will ban these games very fast innapropiete images will  not be shown and bad words will be a hashtag and bad words in game titles will be named (content deleted) and users that make games with sex and bad words will have a permament ban.
",1
"There is no drinking/drugs and smoking, Games i would avoid for under 12 are: Murder mystery 2, Notoriety, Entry point, Jailbreak, life in paradise(has online dating) and any free robux game because they ask for account information.

"If your reading this if you just see a game with has Sex or scams please go to your email and just email roblox like a 100 times okay, If a player swears report them like 2 times or email roblox like a 100 times.

"Don't be irresponsible and let your 7-year-old kid play it.

"And don't say it's for kids over 18, that's just stupid.
",4
"I would recommend to check up on what they're playing whoever, because if your kids purposefully search for inappropriate content, they might find it.

"Only downside is that even though it may be free to play, you do have to pay some money for extras such as Robux and ROBLOX premium.

"These parents need to chill I’m twelve and I play roblox and I do not think it is that bad here are some reasons why :1 roblox hashtags almost everything you say like you can not say crap or gay and you can not even say numbers.

":2 you CANNOT strip it monitors it and makes it so you are wearing clothes.

":3 you cannot swear you can only say hell.

"I think these parents are overeacting ,like if you don’t want them to swear then sit down and talk with them

"So..when my 10 years old son has stumbbled across a game called "" Roblox "" by The Roblox Corporation, I advised my son first that I will inspect the website and saw the violence-based games on the platform.
",0
"There is violence but there is no such things as blood.
",1
"And then..they DEPLOYED RATS IN THEIR FILES!
",0
"And then I stumbbled across SCENTED CON games..filled with profanity, no filter as I think they somehow disabled it.
",9
"I quickly reported it and reported all games associated with it.
",0
"Roblox's biggest flaw are the people trying to give it a bad reputation as creators of SCENTED CON games from exploiters with scripts 18+ like Hentai, porn..You get the point.
",9
"So, it's not that bad..well...compromising accounts, hacking, scamming..Roblox is an unique platform with an intresting playerbase, some of them kind, nice, funny and some of them toxic, racist and mean.
",7
"Some games have violence, and a lot of Roleplay games play BF/GF.
",3
"I feel that some of it can't be a little violent if they are playing certain games.
",3
"So I don't like is she was banned for a few days it says for adult contain she plays the same three or four games she doesn't chat so I don't get what the adult content is.
",0
"I guess my thing is they banned for moderation yet their games can be very violent like cops and robbers or piggy she talks about.
",1
"Other than online daters there is violence,  and drinking, the drinking is mostly 'grape juice' rather than wine, so it isn't too bad for younger children, the violence is not bad.
",8
"Other than violence there is swearing and privacy concerns.
",1
"The swearing is like again, not Roblox's fault, and you can easily block people that swear so you can not read their chat.
",1
"The privacy concerns, is basically your fault.

"Your children are falling for fake 'robux' scams.

"It is not Roblox's fault.

"That is disgusting and vile.

"My baby cries sometimes about it, it can be traumatizing.

"I went through something similar as a teenager and I can see the fear in their eyes.

"Roblox is always upgrading more and more, trying to fix these problems.

"It's not their fault about stuff like many parents say.

"It can happen, but it is against the Terms of Service of Roblox and the moderation team can't get anyone.

"It's not Roblox's fault there's exploiters and hackers.

"Parents just come in at the wrong time, with the wrong mind.

"You should only download this game if you can trust your child not to spend money without permission.

"Tell your kids to stay off of games that have blood or other inappropriate content.

"Dont Buy anything from Roblox

"First of all, if you're celebrating since it downloads software it downloads malware, you're erroneous.

"However, the site withal has some imperfections.

"It's very facile for younger children to culminate up on phishing sites from bot-accounts made by the owners of those sites.

"My daughters account got hacked and the hacker spent $130 of my money on robux but I couldn’t remove my card from the account and had to freeze my card time the bank could sort it out.

"Roblox is like most kids' games.

"Unsurprisingly, my kids cannot play this.

"Since roblox is for all ages, your kids might get annoyed by other kids.

"Robux is quite a issue.

"Your kids might get jealous by other kids with robux.

"What makes this worse is I have took into account that kids play on their parent's phone.

"Some bypassers can make games that revolve around pornography and drugs.
",9
"But, their moderation system is quick to banning any inappropriate games,decals,t-shirts,etc.

"I've been playing video games almost my whole life, I experienced the ups and downs of many videos games and roblox is one of them at the start it may have not looked like a kids game because it wasn't well moderated, but now after some time the moderators fixed that and even got to the point where you cant type numbers, some emojis, curse words, and even the word frick.
",0
"And yes the game is user generated and theres always going to be that type of person making games that aim for porn but no moderators are pretty quit and will shutdown the game and before uploading an image the mods will also review it and see if its kid friendly.

"You may see ads that talk about war or ,""Join this group to get this ___"" those are user generated ads they will not take you to any type website and give you a virus and it also blocks the app discord for texting and messages but can be used for many other disgusting things is blocked.

"But in roblox today I seen people kicking/banning people in server more no reasons,fights happen,swearing,and sex games and robux scams and hackers, Back in 2012 it was not like that it more a peaceful community in roblox and everyone was happy but now there smart mouth people ruining the game.This called cyber bullying and someone has gotta report it gets worse.
",0
"However, there are some violent games here, so make sure to monitor your child.
",7
"Yes, Roblox can be a money suck.
",7
"If your child at least has the common sense of a hamster, they won’t exchange private info with random players, not that roblox’s smart censoring systems even allow them to.
",7
"I mean come on.
",1
"What decent parent would allow their children to play some of the few shooters on the platform in the first place?
",2
"The four swears Minecraft Multiplayer will censor (IF the server’s creator added such a function) won’t stop your children from exchanging their real names, or their addresses, or prevent one person from calling them stupid.
",1
"And if your advice was meant in reference of the single player aspect of Minecraft, why did you even bother to allow your kids who have the self directory of a potato to play online user based games at all?
",8
"I Just Dont Like Trollers...... Or Lag.
",0
"I am really disappointed as my child told me that someone in the server had some weapons.
",0
"And I bet there was smoking in it to.
",6
"Plus they stole 40p of me because my kid put his password on one of roblox's games and stole his money.
",0
"All filthy online daters
",3
"I don't know what's up with all these other families saying this is a ""DEMON GAME"",  people leave fake reviews saying you cant reset your password (you can, obviously), saying kids learn swearing from the site(all bad words are in hashtags) and also, people get bullied too much (possible).
",2
"They make it hard to cancel any chargers or supscriptions.
",7
"Also hard to get any info or contact anyone.
",5
"Anybody who says that there kid has been raped on there is true.
",2
"However, Its the parents fault for not teaching there kids this stuff.
",7
"At the end of the day, Roblox could be dangorous but it can be easily prevented.
",7
"way too much violence like jailbreak or prison life encourages the use of guns and plenty of 18+ games.
",3
"my child unknowingly joined one of the 18+ games and it scarred my child for like.
",3
"theres also so much swearing.
",2
"if your a parent do not let your child play this game it is  so violent and filled with scams, 18+ games, drinking, and swearing
",7
"The only real problems are botted users that my son's nickname for them is ""Scam Bot's""  there basically botted users on the platform bypassing the ""Filter"" (which is ROBLOX's filtering of inappropriate words on the platform, these bots have bypassed this and they put unsafe links on games which if your child is like 7 years old, he/she could fall for it, so warn your child about that, alright here I am for my title, a few parents/children have lied about the Platform saying that they have seen pornographic
",1
"Then they started making very DISGUSTING AND VIOLENT games such as 'Bloody Mary'.
",1
"There is a TON of consumerism so BE CAREFUL!
",8
"The game might contain scenes that will encourage kids to hold knives, or other violent themes, guns and deaths, ALL THAT!
",3
"The game is not as bad as it may seem yes your child could 
",2
"Have been sent porn but I'm sorry hes probable already
",4
"Looked it up by the point where he wants to play roblox 
",0
"And if your dumb parenting leads to your child getting a
",5
"Virus then shame on you I will be honest I thought 2 years ago
",0
"It would be 6+ but now there are a tad bit more oders
",7
"But that's it anything that's in roblox your child has heard or has 
",7
"Seen more explosive stuff at school.
",0
"If you do not feel comfortable about your child playing Roblox, they have account restrictions, pins, and more.
",7
"I don't want my son to grow up and be a criminal and escape prison and shoot people and have a bad record.
",0
"I expect my son to graduate and finish college, not commit crimes!
",7
"It's a good game great game BUT I am 59 play with grand daughter and me my age was invited to a game from a year long friendship and my avatar was RAPED!,,  I have been cussed with the F. .word ....
",0
"I have had them try to trick me to (password  a kid would have fallen for).
",0
"I make games well play in studio don't make but have run into some not so good for children situations.
",3
"I Have been talked to in a very pornographic way.
",0
"I have been in a lot of games some made me sick to my stomach.
",0
"The graphics and horrid things happening .
",1
"All in all roblox is not to blame  THEY DO NEED TO RATE GAMES AS WE RATE MOVIES .
",3
"PARENTS NEED TO LOCK ACCOUNT DOWN TO PRIVATE CHAD AND VI SERVERS AND GAME DEVELOPERS NEED TO REMEMBER WHAT AGE GROUPS THEY HAVE  CHOPPED OFF HEADS, DYING JENKINS COMING BACK TO LIFE TO GET BEAT TO ALMOST DEATH EACH TIME WITH REALISTIC BODY MOVIES OF A DYING PERSON IS A NO NO NO, NOT GOOD FOR ADULTS , I could go on on on on with things and ways to help game be better, once again ROBLOX IN GENERAL IS GREAT , THE DEVELOPERS NEED TO BE TALKED TO AND AGE RATE GAMES ,
",0
"Ugh.
",0
"I know everything there is from Violence to Language.
",2
"ROBLOX prevents most of the curse words but sometimes people sneak curses into words.
",1
"For example they say you’re a SHITzu.
",1
"Sometimes people get around being blocked by putting spaces in between bad words or put 0’s instead of O’s.
",1
"People also give violent messages by bullying or just insulting people with every word they can think of.
",1
"There is also violence in ROBLOX.
",1
"If a game is out of hand ROBLOX will remove it from the website.
",1
"If a user breaks 3 rules they get banned.
",9
"So you’re kid can’t exactly learn curse words from the website.
",1
"Just be aware that there can be hurtful or violent messages.
",4
"Every character in the game looks like a LEGO figure.
",3
"Violence - Use of cartoony weapons in certain worlds.
",3
"Roblox's information for parents says that all uploaded images, video, and audio files are reviewed by moderators before being allowed on the site, but at least one user reported that she's seen characters ""rape"" other characters, and videos of avatar sexual assaults occurring on the site can be found on YouTube.
",0
"Sexual acts aren't visually shown, but the surrounding dialogue and images of characters being held against their will are reminiscent of this violent abuse.
",3
"Minor Language - Although the company claims to monitor and prevent inappropriate language with safe chat, users have reported open rooms and games that can expose players to inappropriate comments.
",1
"If people were saying hastagged comments in your game, that doesn't mean that they were swearing.
",1
"The chat filter censors any words it doesn't recognize, so for all you know, they just misspelled something.
",1
"The worst word you can say if your are under 13 on the site is ""hell"".
",5
"These games are literally impossible to find, believe me, I went looking once to see what all the fuss was about.
",6
"It mostly occurs in the game ""MeepCity"", though the game isn't meant for sex, players (Typically people on alternate accounts who just wanna cause trouble) sometimes attend large parties and put on suggestive outfits, have sex, etc.
",4
"But your child can easily avoid these, and if they are caught up in that kind of thing, it's because they intentionally became part of it.
",7
"There are always people who will try to do this kind of thing, and if you don't want your children exposed to it, then turn off their chat.
",7
"There is a chat filter, and it can be bypassed, for example, my friend and I figured out that you can just say ""$h!t"" in place of the actual word, but eventually it was removed from chat.
",6
"The report system is unreliable, but if you report someone out of game (Go to their profile and click report), they have a chance of being banned.
",5
"A lot of people complained about bullying and being called a noob (An obnoxious short for newbie) due to not spending money.
",0
"that won't get you harassed.
",7
"People claim that being bullied online made their children cry, but if your child is so fragile that being called a noob emotionally scars them, then they shouldn't be using the internet at all.
",7
"If it gets to the point where they become so spoiled that all they do is beg for robux (My little brother, for example), then take away the app or make them do work for robux.
",5
"The game has a lot less bullying and trolling and dating than other games, because less people want to get banned from something they payed real money for.
",6
"By the way, this review was written by an almost-thirteen-year-old, but I wish that people wouldn't treat children as inferior or take them less seriously on these things.
",1
"Hi am John and I let my children on this game and it's horrible.
",0
"Violent language and naked Lego figures were walking around.
",1
"My son played a game with natzies and people shouting WHAT THE F### IS THIS and people not using grammar and I bought my son and daughter 400 roux each and it did not take my details off and I saw transactions of 10000 roux being bought which is 100 pounds so don't let your kids play it
",6
"WHO WOULD WANT THEIr KID TO DO THAT??!?
",0
"This is just terrible
",3
"Just deal in the fact that Robux (currency) is overpriced.
",8
"A lot of people swear and cuss a lot because of one little thing.
",1
"Some games have guns (Jailbreak, Asnenal, etc)  and bloody images and faces (Mansion, Hotel, etc).
",3
"I Think Too Much Violence, And Much More
",0
"Many parents seem to make ROBLOX out to be this terrible site for children and that it is not kid friendly.
",4
"However, in reality, none of that is true if you just follow the right steps and set up your child's account for them instead of having them do it themselves.
",9
"This will make it harder for hackers to log into the account.
",5
"ROBLOX Customer Service can be somewhat stressful when coming to terms with recovering a hacked account or handling billing issues.
",8
"Realize that a hacker will do anything to keep a ROBLOX account in their possession for as long as possible.
",2
"So they will make fake reports against you or your child and accuse them of hacking.
",7
"Everybody is saying Roblox is terrible and scary, my two oldest sons have played it since they were like four!
",0
"If you don't want your kid to see bad things and stuff, you put in your real birthday and they will get safe chat.
",7
"Its automatically its not your choice even.
",4
"If your kid is 13 or older they won't get safe chat!
",7
"Yes there are some games where there is REALLY bad stuff but they automatically get deleted!
",3
"If your child comes across these games and you catch them I strongly suggest you make sure they don't play roblox anymore.
",7
"Without safety things turned in obviously it’s very bad for you g kids but now my kids are safe online
",8
"Yes, there are some violent games but you can just tell your child not to play those.
",7
"There is a chat filter so if someone says something bad it gets censured yet there are some ways to bypass it.
",1
"And if you still don't trust your kid on the site then just monitor your child while they are playing video games.
",7
"You cannot send images through chat.
",9
"You guys with the fake reviews are silly, this site is safe.
",2
"I have seen a few spammers, but they are easy to report to the developer, not once have I seen sex chat or adult pics.
",1
"You people are just bored and hateful.
",4
"Roblox is bad cuz they don’t know ya y’all y’all liken robux cuz dominus to expensive price Ike mil obit
",6
"Certainly not for kids as my kids at school found out.
",0
"Too much violence, swearing, online dating etc.
",2
"These kid called Kreekcraft and username even says it's for kids when it's clearly not as I stated.
",5
"Not sure why Roblox just makes it a 18+ game because that's what it should be.
",7
"Very inappropiate for kids and I would avoid it
",4
"
",0
"Furthermore, as I am a teacher, I have found some kids who don't do their school work and homework becasue they are too busy playing Roblox, even their parents can't watch them 24/7.
",4
"Too addictive and I would limit on how long your child plays Roblox.
",7
"My 10 year old was watching someone named ""Kreekcraft"" and he was play some game called ""Jailbreak"" and he was killing people for MONEY.
",0
"So i told my son get off that video don't let ur kid play this stupid game!
",0
"There is a lot of toxic players but there is also a feature where you can block.
",2
"TADA now they cant see their messages.
",6
"and if you don't want your kids playing a game and they play that game do not blame ROBLOX tell them next time if you see them playing that game punish them.
",7
"Roblox is money grabbing.
",6
"They took away events and Tix, which was great for my daughter as I didn't want to pay real money for Robux or to purchase clothing.
",6
"Games are not that good either.
",3
"What's the point in playing a game where you do the same thing each time?
",9
"I think some youtubers are sometimes hyping their favourite games, only to be disappointed with the updates.
",3
"So,this game is basically the best,sure,it has other violent,apocalyptic games,roleplay games that are meant for 13+,families,expect swearing and....""rape"" culture,pft,funny how much you guys think that's it.
",2
"Roblox is not a game for kids.
",4
"It involves violence.
",4
"Then she met bullies and she went up crying to me.
",0
"Only roblox has hackers and scammers, its pay to win, trolls that bypass the chat, and too much violence.
",1
"Make them not join violent games and tell them not to fall for scams.
",7
"THIS GAME IS SOOOO BAD, MY SON PLAYED A GAME CALLED JAILBREAK WITH MYUSERNAMESTHIS,THEN AFTER THAT MY SON SAID THAT HE KEEPS ON IGNORING HIM, ALSO THERES A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT KEEPS ON SAYING YOUR ""GAE"",AND ""IM GAE"", AND ALSO MY SON KEEPS ON SAYING ""HEY DAD I NEED ROBUX AND PREMIUM, I NEED TO PAY MYUSERNAMESTHIS SO I CAN PAY HIM OUT""
",0
"Later in the day I heard him shout ""Die"" and other inappropriate words, I decided to take a look what he was grumpy about and on his recently played section i saw ""Phantom forces"" and ""GTA Blox city"" And he asked me for ""Roblox Money"" As known as, Robux I immediately uninstalled the game from the family computer and put a more complex password on his account.
",0
"I do not recommend this game to ANYONE under 18.
",4
"The community is trash and most people you meet in roblox is either rude or just annoying.
",2
"Every time my son plays this game he always tells me about how people hack and ruin games what have an objective to do a certain task.
",0
"All in all I wouldn't recommend this game to children below 10.
",7
"Not because they can't handle it.
",2
"For all the parents who is complaining about Roblox:
",2
"
",0
"If your child is seeing some gruesome scenes, innappropriate stuff, swearing, bullying, etc.
",8
"You should not ground them harshly, just talk to them nicely and tell them not to play those games and block those who are bullying in Roblox.
",7
"Roblox does not read reports through game.
",2
"So my daughter played this game and saw a youtuber, who she said is kreek-craft who called salad hair stinky and police having no lives.
",0
"She used this on real cops and the police told me off.
",0
"Could've been worse as I could have been arrested.
",6
"She also hates salads really much and thinks people's looks are very important.
",4
"Roblox should do better to protect our kids.
",7
"Prevent playing the game that is unsuitable for kids, get rid of this bacon v salad thing because youtubers ruin it.
",2
"Avoid at all costs.
",6
"Thankfully I caught him before he took too much of my hard earned money.
",0
"Your kids could be up to no good.
",5
"The game is very disturbing because the small lego men die and are dismembered.
",2
"I will not let my child play this in my christian household ever again!
",0
"but it does have its down sides that can affect you and your son.
",2
"which my son always whants.
",0
"and there is hacking.
",2
"dont take away roblox.
",4
"so just let your son at least 1 or 2 weak days.
",4
"i’ve been reading these reviews from other parents and i’ve seen a lot of parents say roblox has cursing, violence, and scams.
",2
"i am aware this is true but there are many ways you can prevent your child from seeing these things.
",1
"roblox has chat filters which doesn’t let anyone curse yet sometimes kids are able to use numbers to make out curse words.
",1
"if you don’t want your child to see these curse word then you are able to get a safe chat.
",7
"a lot of parents complain about their child spending money on the game or getting scammed.
",7
"if you don’t want your child to spend money on the game simply say no, and the only way your child can get scammed or hacked is if they give out their password.
",7
"I have been playing roblox for long time  the moderation/report management/control system etc sucks I tried to report someone for harassment on me and my friends and they dont care about what people say and no wonder why cant they get it right -_-
",0
"it can be a good game But also a bad one PEOPLE PRENDING TO BE BOYFRINDS AND GIRLFRINDS AND PEOPLE ASKING FOR PERSONL INFORMATION
",2
"Yes there might be swearing and online daters,  just tell your son/daughter IF they ever see a bully, a online dater, or even some people swearing  tell your kid to leave the game that he or she is play another game like adopt me.
",7
"ROBLOX might have a lot of bad but also good.
",2
"I saw one review that said that it was 18+ because they die and fall apart.
",0
"(Also they called them Lego boys XD) Honestly they make a funny sound when they die, and there are a lot of kids games where you can die, like, you would SOOOO hate Minecraft, and even I think Minecraft is fun, so you are soft.
",2
"They have a filter for inappropriate language, and the only questionable usernames I’ve seen are like “poopybutt14” and stuff like that, like funny stuff.
",8
"There are scammers, but most of them are SO fake.
",2
"You all think its Roblox's fault for all these inappropriate games.
",2
"It's not Roblox's fault it's the people on Roblox.
",2
"Roblox is not making the games its the people on Roblox.
",2
"This game needs you to buy something called Robux or Builder's club with real money or you can't get items for your avatar, it doesn't like it said in the AD be anything you can image, and lots of people are online dating in the game such as life in paradise.
",6
"So I have Roblox and I don't think it's for younger kids because people swear on it it isn't Robloxs fault some people just let Thier kids on it and just don't care what they do about 6 times i have seen someone swear jailbreak is a great game it's just that someone time when a player gets arrested they swear at other people using number and letter and space bars to say swears the game is brilliant in many ways you make friends and you can chat to them help them play the game and once someones your friend t
",1
"You may think after browsing this site, ""Roblox is not for kids!
",3
"Yes, there are games with violence, but you can just choose to not play them!
",3
"Now you may be saying that there's language, well, the filter can never fix everything, and no matter what, someone will bypass it.
",1
"Although you can report a player for swearing, and they will most likely be banned.
",7
"Just report them and leave the server!
",7
"There will always be someone, somewhere, doing something innapropriate.
",5
"but it is concerning sometimes for children.
",9
"sometimes i see people swear in my sons roblox game.
",0
"and there is violent games for example your goal for a game called ""Jailbreak"" Is to escape prison, rob banks and other stores, and kill cops.
",8
"which concerns me sometimes.
",6
"BAD DONT PLAY!
",0
"While it is true, that most of the parents have a point it can be addictive, It is not directly the fault of ROBLOX that their children don't have a good interaction with their parents over Roblox.
",9
"There are multiple groups out there that at certain points tell you or your child indirectly ""Hey, There's nothing else to do right now.
",7
"I wish my parents did that with me when I was that age, but they were always too busy and now I still hold that fact over them.
",0
"Moderation, I agree, isn't the best but when you take into account that Roblox has about (at the time of this post)  178 *million* accounts, moderators can't read every single report as quickly as you'd like.
",6
"Moderators are not robots, please do not treat them as such.
",6
"While I agree the platform could use less pay to play aspects, the majority of the platform is free to play unless you want to buy robux or premium membership for your child, and if you think you can just google ""free membership/free robux"" then it does not work that way.
",7
"Even if you use an external site to buy cheaper robux, like V3rmillion, you still run the risk of getting scammed by a user that's not trusted in the community.
",5
"If you're one of those parents talking about how the website gets ""Hacked constantly"", Let me explain how you're wrong.
",6
"Please do report these people using the report button, I do promise you that exploiters do get removed from using the platform.
",5
"I hope I could lay out all the points I saw people complaining about.
",7
"The game is just to inappropriate for kids 
",2
"I went on to my daughters account and saw that she was making friends with people that she didn’t now in real life, also i joined a game called (How to make friends in life and how to get a good education and good grades) now that just pushing it to far I mean what parent would want any of those terrible things for there children.
",0
"And you can say mean words in the game chat and they won’t even get blocked, one player was wearing a t-shirt that said ( 2+7=?
",1
"THIS GAME IS WAY TO INAPPROPRIATE FOR A CHILD THATS UNDER THE AGE OF 18.
",0
"Especially if they can’t properly read.
",7
"There is no profanity in chats, Roblox censors them, and in some games, you may escape a prison, rob banks, steal cars, but this has no effect on my child, it is simply a way for them to be imaginative.
",1
"There is also an in-game currency called robux,  this is something you purchase with real money, but it is very hard for children to get a hold of, they need to put in your address, credit card number, CVC, a child probably knows nothing about that, so how could they waste money?
",7
"Well I don't play that much anymore because of random removals.
",0
"I tried to get my son, my daughter out of the house and spend time together but all they want to play is ROBLOX.
",0
"they didn't look happy, more full of... cringe?
",2
"and honestly, I wasnt looking for that as well since I need to be responsible around the house, but I never got to hang out with my kids so I just left dinner, since my husband could do it for today.
",0
"I mean kids will swear one day or another, it's just how life goes, I am not ready for my kids to swear so I turned their chat disabled.

"they usually play this weird pizza game, so they never communicate anyways.

"i

"Otherwise it is the one of the best video games out there.
",3
"If you find an unfair player there is a report abuse button.
",1
"I think this game is bad ONLY if the child chooses specific games and swearing is possible , there are ways to write the word so tags don't work so be careful this game is innapropiate so is tiktok but i still see kids using it and i see 5 year olds with phones so its weird so do not allow children to play it

"Despite Roblox's efforts at policing itself, including human moderators, digital-civility rules, and other measures, it’s dogged by users with bad intentions, both on the site and off, such as on YouTube, where users upload inappropriate Roblox game clips.Kids can obtain Robux, the in-game currency, by selling game passes, which give players special perks and abilities in games; signing up for a paid Builders Club subscription, which also allows you to sell shirts and other items for a profit; or by purchas

"All I can say is BEWARE PARENTS and don’t let this happen to your child.
",7
"My daughter has said to me she believes she has lost her innocence and that is truly heartbreaking.
",0
"I am sick about the money I gave her for this game.
",0
"Awful.
",0
"The game makers haven’t seemed to have the will to do the right thing and protect kids from being scammed.
",2
"My daughter worked for months to get a certain pet in one game and in a matter of minutes she fell victim to a fake trade and lost everything she’d earned.

"Maybe a good life lesson but seems unethical at the cost of padding game developer’s bank accounts.

"Roblox is a multiplayer website with very BAD games.
",1
"my 9 year old child wanted my permission to play this STUPID game.
",0
"me, so dumb enough, let them play it.
",7
"10 minutes later, I checked on them and they were playing inappropriate games with violent actions, bypassing messages, and disturbing images and places!!!!!!!!
",8
"DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD PLAY THIS GAME IN FACT, DO NOT LE T THE WHOLE FAMILY PLAY IT ITS BADDDDDD!!!
",0
"Roblox may seem really innocent on the surface, but oh I assure you, surprisingly, in a game where you literally play as a sentient lego, there is subcultures which could harm your child's innocence.
",9
"You can find these creepy online daters literally anywhere in online games.
",7
"Condos usually get shut down within a ten minute time span by moderators, however, if a child is brought to a condo by another player, or happens to find one by chance, their innocence will be tainted.
",4
"There are also people who know how to cheat the system in a game to transport you to a room only to show a rape animation.
",8
"There's also the game called the streets where you can knock people out with knives, guns, and fists, and then stomp on them to kill them off.
",4
"But then, at the same time there are those people that cyber-bully that call you stupid, swear, say offensive things about religion and race, even if Roblox tries its best to hashtag out swearwords and possibly offensive words.

"If u search up a bad/innapropriate word in the 'search games' area, likely hood is something bad will come up... thanks for reading if you came this far!
",7
"There are predators and exploiters everywhere.
",2
"Some games do involve violence, but they are mostly just cartoons that are no different from a kids TV show.
",3
"From my experience, there are no games on roblox that would even warrant higher than a PG13+, and if there is they are most likely breaking TOS and will be taken down after Roblox does a review of it.
",6
"What they do is they will take something down, whether a game or decal, etc and put it in the ""review state"".
",1
"This means regular users can't see what that item was, and if it is a game they won't be able to play it and will be presented with a message that says ""This place is currently undergoing review"" or something to that effect.
",3
"If it is deemed to be breaking TOS, they will remove it and depending on what it broke, the creator will either be warned, temporarily banned or in some cases, straight up have their account deleted.
",6
"Roblox's moderation team is very quick to react and punish anything or one that breaks their TOS.
",2
"The reporting system roblox has in place allows a user to report a player that could be either scamming, bullying/harassing or breaking many other different rules.
",1
"Roblox's censorship system, is the worst joke I have ever seen.
",1
"It censors many words, including the vast majority of swear words and the like, yet they can't get them all as new ones are created all the time.
",1
"The issue is Roblox appears to use a Contextual Based Algorithm that will work out anything else that should be censored that may be deemed offensive or inappropriate.
",1
"This Algorithm though gets it wrong majority of the time, and will censor a lot of simple everyday words and sayings, e.g.
",1
"This may not seem like a big deal, but this system causes a lot of frustration, as you often have to work around it to have a simple conversation about say what level you are in a RPG on roblox, or if you say do something ""as well"" as someone else.
",3
"Some players have also got such a handle on how this system works out the context, that it even allows them to bypass it and say highly sexual stuff.
",1
"Continuing with the negatives, a very minuscule part of the community is toxic, nothing you can do about that unfortunately.
",2
"This does include uploading forbidden content, that is sexual or predatory in nature.
",2
"I think its great all of you other people are WRONG!!

"It also helps him talk to people 5 STARS only normies would give it a 1.... pathetic

"I grabbed the console and went straight to here, lots of swearing, and violence with swords.

"I've seen the chat, and its usually not good.
",2
"The game introduces some bad things that kids should not know about.
",8
"Like sex, drugs, abuse, harassment, and more!
",0
"I recommend children 8 and under (The young ones) should be restricted from using the chat at all.
",4
"Take the word: Crap.
",1
"Now take real live stuff, like abuse.

"Some examples are: ''You stupid idiot.

"Also, that also counts as bullying.
",3
"I've encountered teens who would bully me and make fun of me, they would usually harass me on a kids site.

"First of all, why would you say nobody should play it?
",7
"Clearly your children are Online Daters, we people and my son has been trolling them, for ages.

"They could be AFK or the player spawned in, some games mods are bad.

"AND TO ALL FREAKISH ENTITLED PARENTS WHO WANTS ROBLOX BANNED LOOK AT THE ROBLOX YOUTUBERS, CLEAR SENSE IN YOUR HEAD.
",0
"I've now removed the game completely.
",0
"Although there is one option to filter content this then turns the messaging part off making the app useless.
",2
"It needs much better moderation, far more granular filtering and the ability to remove games that are inappropriate.

"In short don't bother until they sort it out.

"On Adopt me a group of kids are telling my granddsughter to kill herself!

"I have been playing this game for a bit over 6 years now, I just think over protective parents are giving this game a bad rep.

"This is the real world there is cussing violence and people saying or doing inappropriate things everywhere you go, it’s not realistic to expect “Roblox” which is a online platform where billions of users worldwide that go on here to not be inappropriate in some way.
",2
"Don’t try to hold roblox responsible for things that may or may not happen on the platform, as a parent it’s your job to make sure your child is safe right so if your letting your child who’s not mature enough to handle the real world on a online platform then it’s your fault if something bad happens.

"Hello, as I saw all the negative reviews on here I'd like to give my own opinion.
",0
"Yes, there is violence, but in no way will it make your kid anymore violent, It's literally just LEGOs fighting each other.
",7
"If your child is encountering the recent wave of predators that have started to use Roblox, just block them.
",7
"There is a feature where you can block someone and they can not speak to you or see what your doing ever again.
",7
"Overall, Roblox has its flaws but the magic it once to us as a kid sadly isn't replicated nowadays due to its social media-esque redesign.
",1
"Okay, first of all the catalog is extremely too expensive!
",2
"This is 2019 it would be nice for a lot of the older hats to come back for 2 robux and the reason I say this is because the ""free"" items in the catalog make your avatar look terrible I am not going to sit here and lie.
",6
"Also, I understand that removing Guests was apart of ""removing exploiters"" but you don't realize Guests are what made this game Roblox..
",8
"Honestly I think everyone is ready to get rid of these tags your team tags everything that isn't bad, but I can understand you blocking out cursing I mean you should of done this back in 2015!
",1
"2015, was the year of destruction, exploiters, and sexist..
",0
"I hope everyone reads this because it has got down to the point   kids can't have fun no more!
",9
"You just put the entire site into danger as I've seen other players use that to sexually harass, troll someone..
",5
"This game use to be for players 8+ but now that I have written my post it should at least be for 16+ Roblox has fallen a lot.. People still complain about your team trying to make roblox into a realistic game using meshes and other dumb stuff.. ROBLOX WAS FOUNDED TO BE A COPY OF LEGOS!
",4
"NOT MESHES, OR RTHRO YOU GET RID OF THE BLOCKY PACKAGES YOU WILL LOOSE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THIS IS HEADING!

"So don’t worry don’t delete the app if you see a scammer just block and report the scammers.

"Also I know your sick of me now I promise this is the last thing.

"You may think this is to violent but I don’t.

"So whenever your characters blows off, jumps into lava,falls from a high place in some games,or just die your character will say OOF!

"my childs account got banned for nothing, the moderation of roblox is really bad, they sayed: Your account has been deleted for creating, promoting, or participating in inappropriate behavior or content.

"This is a violation of our Terms of Use.

"hes 12 years old and didnt do this, roblox says : your account got banned correctly

"Anything else is not allowed.

"Child preds- The wrongest thing on here.
",4
"It is no where near true.
",8
"Even report them if you feel its serious.
",7
"So dont go talking about Roblox if anything has happened to your child.
",7
"It is simply because you haven't educated them enough in online safety, And you didnt care to take a look at their screen every once in a while.
",7
"Bullying- Yes.
",0
"Bullying is here.
",2
"This is the internet and even adults get bullied on social media, So if adults will do it, Im not surprised our kids are doing it.

",7
"Hacks/Scams- Yes there are players that are bots, But dont worry, they are not trying to steal your personal info, Its the account they are after.
",7
"There are ways to fix this, simply report the player, spread the word around about the bots ( lots of kids on there are doing this and is warning others to be careful ).
",5
"I also seen some parents going way out on this hacking thing and saying they can hack into your computer/internet.

"I think that Roblox should be restricted 18. my son was also asking for 100 dollars for ""Robux"" but he was probably online dating.
",0
"I made this review primarily to address the rumours of ""Horrible"", ""Hostile"" and ""Excessively Sexual or Outright Sexual"" activities in Roblox.
",2
"Your child will not find these.
",7
"Not only are these games not allowed by any circumstances on Roblox and are usually deleted within 2-3 hours of them being uploaded but it is also a Misdemeanor to expose a child to pornography on a site that bans it; so you can rest safe knowing your children won't find a game like this.

"If you read the other reviews it says “sexual stuff” and “language” don’t listen to them.

"THIS GAME IS BASICALLY, “PLAY AT YOUR OWN CHILD’S RISK,” game.

",7
"Parents are overreacting over ROBLOX.
",2
"Although granted, there are some violent and upsetting these can be blocked through the options in settings.
",3
"The only real problem is the consumerism, trying to get players to buy robux for higher prices than what its really worth.
",6
"Here’s the bad part: When I play it, i’ve only once seen an inappropriate game.
",2
"So the only bad part is out of the way.
",2
"If you don’t want your kids talking to people in-game, you can easily not allow it in the settings!
",7
"there are no pedophiles lurking around on roblox and it wont even allow you to say anything related to personal info

"it censors almost everything and handles abuse perfectly
",1
"Kids can stumble upon games that show a lot of blood.
",8
"One game shows people that are hung, and others are dead in a bloody pool!
",8
"This is a Very bad site to involve any money or allow your child to have any access to limited items.
",5
"This is the dark side of Roblox.
",2
"Accounts are continuously being hacked for limited items.
",4
"This is not children, grown  people who figured out your child is easy prey.

"On top of this Roblox as a company is very horrible and their customer service is the worst I've ever encountered.

"They will blaime everyone but themselves when something goes wrong with Robux.
",6
"They are very determined that it's someone elses fault.
",2
"Well come to find out these game passes don't exist but it sure will take the money.
",7
"Now I find out this Developer of this said game has had their account terminated and can't get on the game he created to fix these issues.
",0
"So I contact roblox back via their support and I receive a bunch of  remarks of how Roblox has nothing to do with this or the money or the game.
",6
"So if they have no part in this why did you terminate the player/Developer?
",6
"That s not my business is what I am told, but yet they tell me repeatedly that this is who I need to contact to refund my sons robux , but only way to refund is for this said person to send a trade and my son gives them a limited item and they can add the robux into the trade, (in which case Roblox will take 30 percent of the transaction).
",0
"Shew seems like a lot of problem and Roblox certainly wants their cut for them to not be involved in this matter.Needless to say ,days are passed developer is still terminated and my son is still sitting here looking at me to help him fix this, for I am his DADDY.
",0
"I seen a comment from another parent who claims is a small percent, don't I repeat to all parents, do not believe this individual.

"There s many teenagers on here taking advantage of the smaller children.

"Cyber Bulling Is a major problem on this gaming platform.
",9
"Roblox will do nothing about any problems unless it has to do with what players call traders (limited items)  get caught selling items off of other websites.
",8
"These are all scam sites right there on roblox being used to hack your childs accounts.
",5
"So it boils down to is this a safe website, NO it is NOT.

"No child should have to endure a lot of the bulling going on this site.

"They aren't the kids whom get bullied for being a Noob (kids whom have nothing on the game item wise) .
",5
"I am old but I know gaming is expensive.
",4
"I have  locked them out of Roblox due to the nature of what another said of pornography hacks, this is true I have seen this several times as well as very rude and disrespectful messages on clothing made by players.
",9
"Roblox is taking major advantage of children to earn a buck.
",9
"100million users a month is also a lie, theres 100 of thousands of double accounts as well as bot accounts for hacking , stealing, and exploiting you and your children.

"I'm sure with these large amounts of money being transferred that Roblox Interns And Their staff have their greedy little hands in the limited scams as well.

"It Is A Bad Game That Should Be Banned Don't Play it

",0
"My son is four and was very confused

",0
"What I mean by this is, that you will see people with ''fat legs'', tattoos , and most of all inappropriate clothing.
",2
"I also noticed some people had sex on beds and just in general which  bypassed the ROBLOX filter and this stuff broke the terms of service.
",8
"Some people started swearing as well they started saying words like ''Bitch'' and ''Fuck'' and words related to that.
",1
"This could possibly get your children cat fished into thinking it was a person the same age as them and to meet them in real life.

"There are also some games that has violence, such as gun games, murder, and much much more.

"This could really courage your children to do bad stuff.

"There could be great messages but there could be bad messages, especially following, swearing, bullying, and more.

"They don't ban ODER's unless their really really bad.

"Moderators don't do anything as well, the report system doesn't work at all.

"I personally don't think your child should play this game unless a parent is watching them, or you think that they are mature enough to play handle these types of things.

"Problem is hackers constantly stealing all her stuff.

"She had about 8-9 game charactors, all stolen.

"The way that kids are being presented to illegal acts is definitely not something good , not that I at any point said it was.

"Anyway I am expressing this is simply being finished by another person with noxious purpose who is obviously making a decent attempt to be entertaining, lethal or evidently attempting to cause devastation.

"Since I have been on platforms for example, Steam, I can comprehend the harmfulness that is included with networks and how it could effect individuals.

"She’s genuinely traumatized and scared.
",4
"I’m beyond furious that this company that upon researching is not only notorious for ripping parents off (I’ve had it happen too) but worse, they KNOW predators are talking and trying to bait kids and they have done absolutely NOTHING to stop it, they could easily pay a few dollars an hour to moderate each and every game they offer.
",4
"It’s a responsibility they have shirked willfully causing damage to these kids.
",6
"It’s forbidden in our house and should be banned in my opinion.

"First off I will talk about violence, some might think it's too realistic or that it's just violent and it influences the mind of kids.
",3
"It's better off to show kids that if they become soldiers they might get shot by a bullet and not respawn.
",8
"Well better teach them, I guess.
",7
"So many parents talk about online dating on roblox, and, I guess you are guilty for not telling your kid/kids about what strangers can do, their intentions, how to defend, how to understand, kids are always curious so they do the wrong thing to see what happens, because guess what- you don't tell them what happens!
",7
"If the stranger attacks you defend yourself don't run because it will become worse.
",4
"Guess what, most of them may be depressed teenagers, maybe adults or teens with no life, spoiled kids(because you don't tell them what to do clearly) and such.
",7
"A kid can lie about his/her age and the other can tell things not ""appropiate for their age"" but they still understand it cause guess what even if we have different bodies we're still the same species and it's your job to educate us when you're little and not let us into this madness.

",7
"Even if I know about bad.
",7
"By signing up with a account below thirteen years old it will automatically filter inappropriate games that should not be seen by small children.
",1
"Roblox is still trying to fix their filter, but some players may bypass swearing by using exploits (hacks) or adding more letters.
",1
"Some games are very inappropriate.
",3
"These games will be banned and so will the player within hours.
",5
"You may also have to teach your kids about scamming methods that other players use.
",7
"Roblox will not ask you for your password or email and you cannot get free Robux.
",5
"Some players can be bullies and say mean things.
",1
"You can fix this by joining another server or reporting them.
",1
"However, recently my daughter has told me of quite a few things that I find concerning.
",0
"Swear words can't appear but one 'party room' in meep city had 'bitch' written in fairy lights  What was more worrying though was a 'locked' room that you had to be invited in to.
",0
"I feel that there are now so many different games on Roblox that there is no way the owners/programmers can keep an eye on all content.
",8
"And just googling roblox brings up even scarier stories.
",7
"I do not think young children should play this game at all.
",7
"I can lock him out of his account if he doesn't do his homework, chores, etc.
",0
"Folks life is hard and dangerous.
",6
"It's better that our children learn these lessons virtually in an online game than in the real world where it can cause real pain and hardship.
",9
"He's been bullied and he's been cheated.
",0
"b) There are scammers everywhere.
",8
"He knows that you don't get something for nothing and that anyone promising you something for free is probably trying to trick you.
",5
"c) He has learned there are bad peole in the world and he has learned you REPORT those people!
",9
"He has learned ""stranger danger"" isn't just something you hear but it's real.
",7
"d) He has learned about hacking and that hacking is cheating and cheating is bad.
",8
"He's learned that  people will cheat to get ahead.
",1
"For example, I'll say ""remember that guy who tricked you into giving him one of our pets by pretending to be your friend"" well people do that in the real world.
",0
"Cons:
",0
"
",0
"Now with that said here are the real dangers of Roblox: It can be addictive, so set a schedule.
",9
"Another danger is money.
",5
"To so many reviewers who complain about bullying on Roblox.... think about it, your kid has to learn how to handle these people and doing it virtually is better than what I had to endure when I was a kid (constantly beat up in real life when I was his age.)
",0
"Another danger: porn.
",0
"Some were very graphic (child porn.)
",8
"I reported them to Roblox and the FBI (child porn) but did not hear back from either however, I have not seen it return.
",0
"While this is a real porm, the image quality is usually pretty low resolution.
",9
"Roblox has flaws such as trying to solve a problem by removing stuff but, the real problem is the community.
",1
"Roblox's community is filled with trolls, Oders (Online Daters), exploiters, and haters.
",3
"Second, please teach your child about online safety and the bad things that could happen.
",7
"Now its time to talk about Roblox's fault.
",7
"Roblox dose nothing to solve the problem of rule-breaking in the game.
",6
"They had the same chat filter (with some bad updates) since the beginning and it has proven to not be effective, alot of people managed to bypass the filter by changing a few letters in words like F*** to Fuxk and like  Sex to Sux or Six.
",1
"Roblox tried to fix this problem by making the chat filter even more strict by censoring innocent words and numbers, all this just gave even more criticism that Roblox just ignored.
",1
"Finally, please watch these videos because im tired typing so much

"Ok so Ive read quite a few comments on stuff like  ""oh this game is rlly inappropriate for kids and has a lot of ""violent"" and ""sexual"" games.... Ive been playing for over 4 years and guess what???
",6
"I dont really understand what you mean by ""too violent"" just because they use guns or knives.... there are much worse games your kid can be playing other than roblox and if you don't want your kid exposed to this kinda stuff then just keep him off the internet for the rest of his/her life cause the Internets full of this stuff.
",7
"I mean are u gonna babysit ur kid for the rest of his life so that he never gets exposed to the word penetrate?
",6
"And keep him off any games with guns for fear hes gonna rob a bank when hes older??
",0
"Stop over reacting and let your kid have some fun in his/her life instead of dulling it down to number games and math questions
",4
"I heard everyone was saying ROBLOX has a bad influence, but when I saw my son play it, I went to look at it myself.
",0
"All those other bad reviews are false, you should really let your child play it.
",7
"I am not an ""Admin"" or any of that, so don't spam me with ""Your moderation sucks"" type of responses.
",1
"The world doesn't revolve around your kids.
",9
"They saw one bad thing, doesn't mean it will terror them for life.
",0
"it shousald be a 5+ game ITS NOT VIOLETNT!!
",1
"I’m going to be honest I lied about my age so parents could see this but honestly I have been playing roblox for 4 years now and I have seen 3 innapopriate things on all my time all of them being hackers and that’s it.
",2
"You see unlike every other review on here it’s really not the way it sounds like they say it’s filled with innapropraite content but It’s all about the games you play if you know what games to avoid I promise you you will never see a single innapropriate thing on this sight.
",3
"All the reviews here with people saying players have asked them to do sexual things with them in game is a lie how are they going to get across like that?
",2
"And if they find a child predator just teach them internet safety tell them not to add random people on discord and if your child is under 10 and doesn’t know much about internet safety if you go into settings and then privacy you can make it so you can’t communicate with other players.
",7
"I’m going to be honest the worst part of this game is that it’s full of micro transactions everywhere but it may help your child learn things like saving money and not spend all of it at once.
",6
"Roblox is more of a development platform then a game and you can make games with it but it is hard.
",8
"That last part might sound stupid but it has happened many times before.
",2
"Even worse it wasn't even pix elated.
",3
"I do not recommend Roblox to parents that don't want there child exposed to early to Pron and Sex.
",7
"As of a lot of people reporting being banned for 'no reason' you were all banned for a reason,you cannot be banned for 5-7 days WITHOUT a reason if an error happens ROBLOX is yet to always apologize to its fellow players.
",6
"Next being scammed and suing ROBLOX for it.First of all it's NOT ROBLOX's fault your kid fell for a scam.ROBLOX  cannot make sure there is NO scams at all,since there is now more then BILLION of users on its platform it's not its fault you  have a kid that'll do anything for free robux.
",7
"Getting charges on debit card.This is pretty much impossible since ROBLOX does NOT save debit car/credit card information so it's most likely that someone got your credit/debit card information and is using it to buy robux.So stop blaming ROBLOX for this.
",7
"Now onto some things everybody's talking about and hating on ROBLOX for it (EVEN THO IT'S MAKING NO SENSE)
",9
"-removal of tixs
",2
"what can I say?Tixs were free to get,as ROBLOX is a company that needs money to countinue its work it was a big bump in the face since they got NO money to keep the game going.
",3
"-'bullying'
",0
"They say calling someone a 'noob' is bullying noob means new player/you just started and it's in no meaning harmfull.Calling someone out for not having robux IS bullying but let's be honest..how many people do that?Not so many when you think about it.
",9
"-violents and/or brain damage
",2
"""OH NO GUYS A LEGO FIGURE JUST FELL INTO PIECES I NOW HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE HELP!!
",0
"""Is what these parents say.It's a lego figure..a lego figure how can that brain damage you?It's like you built something of legos and it fell on the ground and got into pieces and it brain damages you..
",2
"-reports are FAKE
",2
"First of all no reports are NOT fake.They say this since ROBLOX with its MORE THEN BILLION users cannot ban every single one with 3 reports.How many people do you think there is in moderation team?Yes it can be big,but not all of them are working on reports some of them have to see every it
",2
"-ODing/Online Dating
",0
"Online Dating is a problem on ROBLOX but let's face it never got so far it got into real life and most of the time it's hugging or holding hands or in EXTREMELY rare times it's kissing.Is this really that much of a problem?Having in mind that it never got very far.
",0
"There are incidents with sexual contact etc, but you can’t blame ROBLOX for it’s not their fault.
",1
"It’s also not the developers fault either.
",9
"This can happen on a rare occasion when it does happen, you should report the player and email ROBLOX.
",5
"It can leave children very sad when parents purchase Robux and other gamers steal their Robux.
",4
"It is very expensive to buy Robux and when they are stolen, customer support acts like you are the criminal.
",6
"Very disappointing.
",0
"one review i saw said it had something to do with drugs!?!?!
",0
"are you out of your mind was it roleplay like what.
",0
"there is a popular game right now called mad city which is about prison so if youre too scared about what your child will start thinking of then dont let them play.
",3
"if someone calls your child a noob then that doesnt mean its a bad word the word noob means new.
",5
"if your child is getting bullied then just report the bully (by presing the esc key clicking a flag next to the bullies name then tell what the bully did) .
",9
"so thats why you sould let a six year old play it.
",4
"if you think that your child can come across a horror movie character then just say pictures like that dont exist because before the picture is published to roblox the picture is always sent to someone to see if its apropriate for the website if the picture is inapropriate then it means the person will its sent to will decline bringing it to roblox the sending method works also for clothes hats and other thngs people can put on the website.
",6
"It is easy to get hacked but a way to avoid this is to turn on 2-step verification.
",5
"Also there is a chat filter but sometimes people can get away with saying something that is like a bad word but not exactly.
",1
"But I mean parents cuss around kids a lot (at least in my experience) so it should not be of too mush concern.
",7
"There is a tiny bit of violence, but no blood.
",2
"I can tell you everyday I have played I have been bullied or harassed by someone for items or robux!
",5
"I as a new player cannot even get 5 minutes into the game before I am killed or bullied!
",0
"These games are not safe for kids to be in if they are treated the same as I am being treated and I am an adult!
",3
"I do not recommend it to kids!
",7
"They have stolen money from my account on numerous occasions then cancel the entire account when it's disputed.
",0
"They didn't give me the credit then lied about it.
",0
"They send automated messages only.
",5
"You'll never talk to a live rep. about a concern.
",6
"I emailed the moderators about an abusive player typing curse words in other languages they got back with me in less than 24 hours and banned his/her account.
",1
"Right when I made an account, I was bombarded with games showing very inappropriate content.
",0
"I joined one of them and all the other players kept calling me ""NOOB, NOOB"" and said that they called me this because I didn't have ""Robux"".
",0
"After this experience, I tried to contact the administrators but they said that there was nothing they could do.
",0
"Now I will never let my daughter play this game again.
",0
"My son played is for a while and i play it with him but i hate false reviews they say that they send pictures but roblox doesnt allow pictures and it cant be ascii art because there is an 150 limit and someone said that they changed their wallpaper by someone on roblox but the hack client CANT EVEN HACK THE PERSON IT ONLY HACKS THEIR OWN CLIENT
",0
"This game website has a lot of killing games like a game where kids stab each other and get money so they can get upgrade their knife,a youtuber that makes videos showed off that game and this game website has a lot of bullies that like to harass people, even more low key games are bad, in meep world kids have houses and  adult parties and try to date  and they can adopt on some of these games and marry too and and other terrible games that are not fit for children.
",8
"the game allows you to report someone if they are swearing or being a bully but it does nothing,they don't get kick off the minute you report them even if you do it more than once and roblox will not protect your child either.
",7
"this game is a waste of time, money, and life.
",6
"Life should be more precious than exposing yourself  to bad games,being harassed, dirtiness and bad examples.
",4
"And a bully doesn't have to swear all they have do is say hateful things to you and then you will feel awful and terrible and roblox won't do anything to punish the bully.
",4
"roblox is not one of them.
",2
"There is almost never any 18+ content and will remain that way for a long time.
",3
"The game is only including 18+ exploiters and it isn't in your hands just to report it.
",9
"They have a bad system that needs to be fixed such as random bans after reporting someone.
",1
"The game is now also going corporate sadly.
",2
"You could buy stuff for free but the game made the Decision  to go coporate and not listen to the community.
",1
"but there is a dark side, with games that are only about Sex!!!
",2
"This game is horrible my son wanted to play this I let him when I looked at his phone he had gave a stranger his number on the chat it is not safe especially with chatting to strangers and the launguage that is used.
",0
"There are inappropriate games for other parents out their keep your children safe please.
",4
"this game bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",0
"sike
",1
"I went into one and it was horrible.
",0
"The clothing they were wearing was so disrespectful.
",0
"Along with horrible actions and words.
",4
"This game is definitely not suitable for kids.
",4
"There was spam and I just had to leave.
",0
"I wouldn't recommend playing this game without parent supervision.
",7
"As you see, if you report a player it doesn't really work anymore which is a problem.
",5
"It would be hard enough work to even try to catch up with it.
",5
"There are a ton of people who insult each other on Roblox, it's pretty common now.
",2
"Now, there is a whole ton of Online Daters...It is very, VERY common in Roblox right now.
",2
"They're practically every where, which you should possibly avoid or block if things get too worse, the violence isn't that bad.
",7
"There isn't too much blood nor, any gore here unless it's the developer or creator who made a game with blood in it.
",3
"This could be dangerous for kids.
",5
"If you’re kid has a bad influence DO NOT LET YOUR KID PLAY THIS GAME!
",2
"And moderators do a 
",2
"  bad and unfair job so keep that in mind.
",1
"and there’s free robux scams  everywhere.
",5
"Please note online interactions I cannot rate.
",2
"So online interactions can be a little inappropriate.
",2
"And discord and twitter are 13+ sites so to avoid you’re child from clicking social media links please do not let your kid play ROBLOX.
",5
"And there are child predators that pretend to be a child and try to get the kid to tell them you’re location.
",7
"The kid needs to know NOT TO TELL ANYONE IN ANY GAME YOU’RE LOCATION.
",7
"The game is out of control is impossible,to control who play with your children's, .The game have violence ,and bad choice of music and languages, is a terrible game and scary  for parents.
",3
"It shocked me to see that title so I went in and saw kids killing themselves in various ways including shooting themselves in the head and then there was the cloud of blood.
",0
"Also, you should talk with you child about internet's dangers anyway.
",7
"She joined a game called ROBLOXIAN highschool, and everyone called her a noob.
",0
"I gave them the robux, because i didn't want to see them sad, and the next day i saw my 11 year old dating a roblox boy!
",0
"I really don't reccommend this if your not wanting to spend money.
",4
"Y'all being cowards.
",9
"Yes there is bad parts of Roblox.
",2
"Like Toxic Players, Scammers,Hackers, And Nasty content.
",0
"But that's just because Roblox has been corrupted since the passing of the Owner of the game.
",7
"Yes I'm aware the moderation of the website is stupid.
",2
"I reported someone once and they done darn crap about it.
",8
"But fyi reporting doesn't work anymore.
",3
"But don't do anything stupid like stealing your parents money for Robux, Hack, Scam or bully or do anything sexy like try to online date.
",4
"If you don't like the game.
",3
"If you're a parent who likes to shield their children from violent video games, there is a lot more to Roblox than just violence!
",2
"The only problem with Roblox is that the community isn't as good as other games.
",1
"Just monitor them, because there's people on Roblox who Online Date, even though it is against Roblox TOS Rules and Guidelines, and your kid can get in trouble for doing so.
",7
"honestly to me roblox is actually starting to become a 13+ game than 10+ because most users now is doing things that are not allowed but roblox admin do nothing about it most of the time i know this because i used to play roblox
",2
"Alright, I thought AJ was bad.
",0
"So, heres some things You need to know about Roblox,
",7
"1) There's tons of sex, usually You'd be thinking You're child is playing a safe game usually it is other ''Children'' playing, I see these people as Pedophiles only because they are commonly caught asking to meet up, or having sex with younger ages.
",2
"Moderaters really do nothing.
",3
"3) Violence is crazy, I've been threatened about being murdered many times it ain't My experience I'm worried about it's the younger ages.
",9
"6) Roblox Anthro just didn't help anything within the game.
",6
"I highly believe it's for 12+
",4
"I would not reccomend the game to any children under the age of 12.
",4
"roblox bad it are suck my son pla and he comes and ask for money and i is so poor he spent 533$ in one year he everytime came he ask for alot of money and he stays up too 6 hours on Roblox.
",0
"Its graphics take alot of internet megabytes and it has alot of swearing.
",3
"Also, saying ""noob"" is common word not a swear word, that usually happens when you do something stupid or even try.
",1
"Its ok to have your own opinion but, saying roblox is innapropiate for children, dont all the time believe the medias try out yourselfes!
",2
"Roblox very rarely affected childs' behaviour if it was already that sort of behaviour thats not the point.
",2
"Don't worry about innapropriate content its always deleted.
",2
"But, who plays from medium or poor countries, is mainly think that ROBUX and builders club is expensive.
",2
"Some games like ""MeepCity, Robloxian Highschool, and Royale High"" indirectly encourage online dating, but that's mostly the community's fault, and it's not all that goes on in those games.
",8
"Roblox has been cracking down on games like this recently aswell, especially with MeepCity.
",2
"Watching my daughter play the 13 and under version of the game, I was shocked to see how much violence is encouraged on the game.
",0
"On the game called Mars Baby Simulator, your avatar  is encouraged to ""kill"" other characters by punching them.
",1
"I heard a replay of a programmed voice that kept repeating ""killing spree"" as the characters punched each other to kill each other.
",7
"This positive verbal reinforcement coming from the game as characters kill each other is very dangerous for children as they are still making sense of the world.
",2
"Even with the extra layer of security I placed on the account, I still saw many instances of encouraged killing on the game.
",1
"I chose to delete the game so my 8 year old daughter will not be desensitized to murder/violence .
",0
"Although it happens in cartoon form - it is still violence acted out repeatedly, which is not acceptable.
",6
"Please think twice about downloading this game.
",7
"This is so troubling to see these kids being so addicted to this game.
",6
"Roblox  does not care about the lasting mental affects on our kids.
",0
"Roblox should be ashamed of themselves.
",4
"The game learns children about communism.
",8
"Roblox might seem like a friendly community but the common sense reviewers think there’s education most of these are violent and have blood effects,guns,and fighting.I do not recommend this to younger kids because I older kids have found a way to bypass and say swears in acyonyms and more.
",2
"Many people say that Roblox is very inappropriate for young viewers, which in some cases are correct.
",1
"Hackers and exploiters will find a way to hack into a game, or even peoples accounts.
",1
"Certain words that are considered bad will be replaced with hashtags.
",1
"Moderators will be scanning them first, if is considered bad, the person who uploaded the picture will be get a warning, or banned.
",6
"If there is someone you think is doing the wrong thing, you can report them for whatever reason.
",7
"I have been playing Roblox for 4 years now and I dont see anything wrong with the game itself, but the game has gotten so big to the point where the are not enough Moderators and Administrators to be able to safely and effectively manage the community.
",1
"Regarding the community, people can be toxic sometimes and pretend that they are better than everyone else because they have ""cool clothes"" or ""expensive hats"".
",4
"The helicopter parents that claim the game is ""Sexual"" or that their child was sent pornographic messages is false.
",4
"Don't get turned off by those imbeciles, they've never actually experienced the game.
",6
"Many are complaining about the “sexual content” on ROBLOX.
",2
"Of course, I’ve heard about them, and seen one inappropriate game, but it was taken down quickly.
",0
"The quote un quote sexual content isn’t an issue if you educate your children on what to do if they see it.
",3
"Again, this is just something that you need to teach to your children.
",7
"Just tell them that it is wrong.
",7
"I don’t see online dating as much anymore, though it’s true that ROBLOX hasn’t been doing anything to help it.
",8
"Another problem, in that category, is the pedos.
",1
"This, sadly, is true.
",2
"The violence in this game is acceptable.
",3
"This really isn’t anything graphic.
",3
"In fact, it’s the opposite.
",1
"I don’t get why others say there is.
",4
"There are games in ROBLOX that will definitely try to scam you, taking your account or ROBLOX.
",5
"In-chat scamming is just a block and report thing, again, the term free robux is common.
",5
"It’s not ROBLOX’S responsibility if your kid gets scammed by an off-site link, as mentioned above in my sexual content paragraph.
",7
"It will make the game more dull for your child, though.
",8
"Currently, there is NO way you can get hacked (unless your kid gives out their username and password) or get a virus from ROBLOX.
",5
"The only way to get viruses is to download certain audio off the website, most people don’t know how to do this and don’t use it.
",1
"All the concerns on here are highly overexaggerated.
",8
"The man had hacked porn on the wall and was getting my kid to say weird stuff.
",0
"Also people treat other players mean and call them nubs and they curse in ways that is not blocked out in hashtags.
",1
"Its an overall horrific game.
",5
"Not only that my 8 year old son is now addicted to this game every time I tell him not to play that game he throws a tantrum and smashes doors and hits me and says he hates me and wants me to die I have to do something about this do not let your kid play this game ever please.
",0
"Some people can bypass the roblox chat filter but if they do cuss, you can report them and they can get a warning or ban.
",1
"A moderater will check it and if it's inapropriate it will be denied.
",7
"The reviews are a bit... 'Overreactive' So, i've decided to make this review First of all: ROBLOX is a kids game.
",2
"Yes, there is scams etc.
",8
"People with inappopriate language too.
",5
"ROBLOX does NOT support online dating.
",6
"How ya' parents see it is: ""OmG WhAt Is ThIs My ChIlD is hAvInG a CoNvErSaTiOn?!??!?!?""
",2
"like... WHY?
",0
"All games have bullies because that is the real world.
",8
"There are games that encourages self-harm.
",3
"Though you don’t see blood shed, but the idea is really bad.
",3
"Murdering.
",0
"If your age setting is older, more chance your kids will see inappropriate words.
",7
"Strangers impersonating to be kids, and start asking them to do stuff.
",3
"There are millions of games there, who knows what they’ll pick next, and I saw oneRoblox game  call “suicide” .
",3
"aight, so recently i've been seein' a ton of parents and children calling this game the spawn of satan, but i'd have to disagree.
",6
"mk i'm too lazy to add more gn
",6
"but some people can be disgusting sometimes but, overall really great game!
",2
"So basically parents are saying this game is dangerous and creepy, And people are saying they are pedophiles and abusers on the website, Well open your mind
",2
"There is a 0.1% chance you will be attacked by a predator.
",7
"There is a 0.1% chance your child will be encouraged to buy guns in real life because of the weapons in the catalog.
",3
"Basically its not Roblox's fault.
",4
"One thing is that many people make scary and violent games.
",3
"That's not a good thing.
",3
"Although,  everything you can buy is super expensive.
",8
"And if your children  ""date"" on ROBLOX they can  get kidnapped.
",7
"Roblox isn't as bad as you people put it.
",1
"God, quit over exaggerating.
",6
"First off, about the ""sexual messages.""
",9
"If you find that your kid is being bothered by horny 3-year-olds that want to steal their Roblox virginity, block the person.
",7
"I can't stress this enough, it's like people here don't care what their child is doing and leave them alone on the computer 24/7 and then wonder why their child is cussing.
",7
"Just download a computer monitoring software, for crying out loud.
",0
"If you don't want your innocent little Timmy seeing the bad bad words that are oh so threatening, get him off of Roblox.
",7
"Do SOMETHING other than just whine about it to your other soccer mom friends.
",4
"Third, inappropriate games.
",1
"I can tell you, they do get removed if they have sexually explicit content.
",5
"If you don't want Timmy seeing a bad bad advertisement, get an ad blocker.
",8
"On the note why this is 4 stars, I do find the online dating and the community to be toxic at times, but you really can't do anything about the community.
",2
"You can't change the way other people behave.
",1
"The moderation system is complete dog s***, as for many other communities and games out there today.
",1
"There is cartoony guns,paintball guns, swords, weapons and bombs but there is no gorey graphics, If someone starts cussing ROBLOXs filter will tag it (like hashtags).
",9
"People sometimes OD (Online Date) but it is against the terms and they can be given a warning or well,banned.
",1
"A lot of people say consumerism is a big factor, I beg to differ.
",8
"However, there is a bad side to it.
",2
"ROBLOX has worked very hard to fix the community up and has done well but not enough.
",6
"Some of these bypasses can be explicit and even racist.
",1
"My child was harassed by other users and the response I was given by the Roblox Support was very vague and delayed.
",0
"No action was taken.
",0
"My daughter is no longer allowed to play the game.
",0
"Roblox is a game where I think, is 9+
",3
"
",0

",8
"Why i think roblox could be recommended for kids 8+ is mostly because kids younger than that may not be able to handle the violence depends on which games (not all the games are violent) as there is so many kids that think its cool to swear or they are trying to be mature on a kids platform as well as there are ODERS (online daters) that like to do questionable stuff but its mostly in roleplay games so if you dont play those games your good.

"It might get boring after some time due to the lack of games though.

"Ok now on the main point that I wanted to say parents should warn their kids before they start playing ROBLOX is that there are a lot of scammers that will take your account, but don't let that prevent you from letting your child play, it is very easy just to avoid those scammers, so for me to tell you how to do it I gotta tell you what scammers make scams for and that's Robux which is an in game currency that you buy with real money using a credit, debit, gift and many other types of cards, so the scammers

",5
"STOP VIOLENCE AND GAME SEX!
",0
"I'm not sure why people are leaving bad reviews.
",7
"Because that all of the servers on this computer game are user-created, there will naturally always be 'trolls' in the community.
",8
"The unpredictability of this computer game means that extremely offensive themes will always show up, including to nudity and pornography, sexual intercourse and other sexual themes like dating and rape, inappropriate language due to the easily avoidable chat filter and extreme violence (including blood and gore, as well as heavy gun use in some servers, including suggestive language, such as ""headshots"" and ""killstreak"").
",1
"These Robuxes can be used to buy in game cosmestics and accessories leading to an unhealthy idea of gambling, wasting money, and an idea to young children that you need to have alot of money and the coolest clothes to be popular.
",6
"All in all, ROBLOX is an extremely dangerous computer game which is harmful for young children and even teenagers' minds, with suggestive sexual content, pornography, explicit language, intense violence as well as much more dangerous things which are certainly NOT suitable for any child.

"ROBLOX THEY ARE LEARNING THE BAD
",0
"The idea of making a currency for In-game accesories is great, but the problem is that there is no way to get free ROBUX, so scammers create a LOT of bot accounts on the game itself, to make childs think it is possible to actually get free in-game currency.
",2
"The problem is that a very small minority of ROBLOX players are here to actually have fun, which is sad.
",2
"Third, the hackers/exploiters.
",1
"I know hacking can be funny sometimes, but it can ruin the entire game experience of tons of players.
",2
"There are also the people that bypass the chat filter (Which was created because of over reacting parents).
",1
"When I realised it,  I was really sad, but then, when I got unbanned, I NEVER tried to troll, insult, or anything bad.
",6
"Roblox does sometimes have some innapropriate content but it is really rere (at least i never really see it), and yes bullying can occour but it is also VERY rare, trolling is not actually a problem in roblox.
",2
"Every once in a while, an inappropriate game is published, but it never makes its way to the front page and inappropriate games are extremely, extremely hard to find.
",3
"Also, exploiters/hackers are almost non-existent on the game.

",6
"Two weeks later I happened to be hacked, I dont even know what it was!

"I had my email in it and everything..I think the person that hacked me, was knowing to be a 9 year old..What scares me is that he has all my information on all of my social medias too..

",0
"We all know this but Roblox isnt perfect.
",2
"There will be some people out there to ruin other peoples day.
",1
"But just know that it isn’t the main goal of Roblox to promote sexual intercourse or violence.
",1
"It is just a kid game and those who break the rules will be subjected to moderation action.
",5
"i know the mod system is not that great but, can you expect all of your reports be done did done?
",2
"Plus their is some exploiters but some are harmless and just want a speed boost and stuff
",1
"As a kid he used to spend money on stupid things.
",6
"But some are violent so toddlers could not play it.
",5
"You can create anything but if it is not appropriate they are usually banned within 2 hours and these games are incredibly hard to find.
",6
"Yes, there are downsides to the community, like ODers (online daters) that play these “adopt and raise a baby” games (or similar titles).
",3
"These ODers are either 8 yr olds that don’t know what they’re doing or 30-50 yr old benign pedophiles.
",4
"Other games might be more violent, containg guns and such.
",8
"But when your avatar “dies,” it just falls apart like a lego man being taken apart and scattered.
",3
"The chat filter system just straight up sucks, it censors numbers (12 and under) like maybe you try to say how much I’m game currency you have but instead of saying “I have 57 coins,” you say “I have ## coins,” which in my opinion isn’t very great.
",1
"There are also exploiters, these people like to ruin games or mess around in them.
",1
"But if you don’t like it, you can just leave and go to a different server.
",7
"You should also look out for scams and scambots.
",8
"There are minor scams like a person asms you to send you their password (pretty obvious if you understand) but then there are others like the thousands and thousands of bots sending messages to all the players telling them something like “Go to [LINK] to get FREE ROBUX today!

"There is so many parents dropping horrible reviews on Roblox saying that it's for 18+ Now imagine this, Having a school game were teachers and students can join and have like a fun but educational game.

"Hackers can change stuff into porn, so I recommend to let your child stay away from games that can be hacked easily (meaning that it gets hacked a lot) or just don't let the child play the game, and stay near to the child while they are playing a new game.

"Roblox can put a junk load onto your computer.
",9
"The community and moderation are poor but with the right enough of protection over your child, him/her can play Roblox.

"Roblox doesn't let you say names of anything or doesn't let you say numbers.

"Due to the main stream media especially in the United states, articles have been criticizing this game, and most of the parents on this website are saying that ""oh dear one minor offence happened that i could have clearly prevented by being a better parent and monitoring my child's content has just occurred who should I blame?

"with minor exaggeration this is the parents who put 18+ 17+ and, 13+ , usually with events of hacking ,inappropriate language, and Child predatory actions.

"Their are concerning problems about the game such as lack of moderators, and the fact that it takes a while for some bad games to get deleted.

"Hacking is somewhat of a problem but you can't blame the entire game for that matter, again monitor your kids account, i myself have played Roblox ever since 2 months of it's release in 2006, and still I've only been hacked twice both times the moderators helped me.

"Don't listen to those other reviews, they are just from over-protective parents.

"Many of these reviews are either ironic or describe situations that are extremely rare.

"And to cancel the account for some parents that want to just change her password and log out SO EASY!

"This game is NOT for kids.

"I believe that this game is very: Violent, Too much sex, too much swearing, and Safety and Privacy concers.

"Don't let your kids play this.

"No matter what age you are, you are NOT allowed to curse.

"The only violence is the deaths in ROBLOX and in any game's where it's the game's base.

"There is no swearing due to ROBLOX's chat filter, but they took it a little too far (you can't even say numbers.

"Roblox is basically a cartoon, and is extremely unrealistic.

"I mean, who falls apart when they die.

"Roblox is addicting, but can cause children to believe false things.

"Since ""Robux"" is highly overpriced, there are many scammer sites that offer free robux in exchange for personal information and account details.

"However sometimes the moderation dosen't listen to bullies so I think its 6+ or up

"I threw the iPad out the window and was horrified on what I saw.

"But they DO shoot at each other, which has now spilled out into his real life in disturbing ways.

"Price for builder's club or Robux isn't worth the money.

"Lots of bullies, cursing, and people that make Roblox not fun to play.

"Though this is rare but there games with pornographic content, online dating and tons of other stuff that violate Roblox's Terms of Service rules.

"Yet if you report people this is what happens: nothing, and in rare cases, you get banned/terminated for ""Violating Terms of Service"".
",7
"I played Roblox to experience it myself and it was ATROCIOUSLY TERRIBLE.

"Even with the chat filter, there are people who can bypass the filter and still curse, it also filters inoffensive words and numbers.
",1
"And that's not all there are also scams that say ""Go to this website ""Sampletext.com"" for free Robux"".
",8
"The Online dating thing needs to stop NOW!

"You parents don't want child predators or Pedophiles targeting your children.

"Like I said before UNINSTALL ROBLOX AFTER READING THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT SOMETHING LIKE WHAT I SAID TO HAPPEN!

"You ripped me off for 150$ I will tell everyone and you have 10,000 other people you've ripped off drop off the website suckers
",0
"But this only scratches the surface.
",4
"Most games revolve around mature content and hard-to-understand aspects of gameplay.
",1
"As it is a community built game, kids will make worst content and some will make great content.
",1
"I'm not saying Roblox has a toxic community, they do.
",2
"It's filled with bullies and racists, but that is why I suggest you to be 14 years of age or higher to play because you need to learn how to cope with people.

"In all forms of social media, this happens everywhere, sexting conversations, bullying on comment sections, etc.

"Tell your child to avoid players with ""thick thighs"" or ""Bear mask"" or ""ice arms/legs"" because those players are trying to date on a kids app.
",7
"The game can get bloody but there really isnt that much gore involved.
",3
"Almost every item for your avatar costs ROBUX, you need to spend real money for robux, and the prices are very unfair.
",6
"Only a few players on roblox are actually kind and show respect, but a good chunk of the community are mean, anti-social or just flat out rude.
",2
"Overall, dont let your kid play this, wait until they get older.
",7
"My 11 year old plays ROBLOX and loves it, but I am concerned; one time she told me that a roblox guy grabbed her and threw her into the bed...can I call this online rape?
",0
"This is why you need to watch out for Online Daters.
",7
"We have also seen things in the chat like “hey bae get in bed” or something STUPID like that.
",1
"The news articles always tell lies about the game.
",2
"Most people who try to 'date' doesn't even mean anything by it.
",1
"And if they do try doing something 'weird' It's normally their excessive use of YouTube or what their parents have done bringing them up.
",7
"It's not predators you should worry about it's what you teach your kids and what they do online with what you've caused them to do.
",7
"There's almost no predators on this game, but what online game doesn't have predators anyway?
",2
"There's always going to be that 1% like any other online game, you can't expect it to always be 100% clean.
",5
"The news will report on whatever they can get their hands on, so don't believe the stupid articles.
",5
"Someone could've just wrote something fake and put it in the news for a bit of dosh.
",2
"If you really worry about weird things online then just don't let your child even go on YouTube, Xbox, Playstation, Club Penguin Island, Moshi Monsters (If that's still relevant), Bin Weevils, ect.
",7
"Don't blame the games, blame the parents who let their child mess around on the darker sides of YouTube or wherever they learn the weird stuff they do on these online games.
",5
"Now they only have a moderation team of 17 so it’s hard for them to read reports and moderate everything but they have enough bots on the site so it’s almost impossible to do anything 18+.
",6
"Then one day he came home from school and logged in only to find his account had been deleted with the message, “Don’t create accounts just to harass players and break rules.” This was a shock to him.
",0
"Neither of us could figure out how or why this happened.
",6
"I immediately filed an appeal and asked for proof that my son had violated their rules.
",0
"Because the account had been deleted there was no way for me to prove anything or figure out what happened.
",0
"The moderator was  extremely curt and offered no assistance whatsoever.
",3
"In the end my son was heartbroken and lost not only his money but the connection he had with his classmates who continued to play without him.
",0
"Had I known the customer support was this awful I would never have let my son sign up let alone spend his hard earned money on the site.
",6
"First of all, the report system is ignored by the staff.
",1
"Second, exploiters, a heck of a lot of exploiters.
",2
"Third, this is rare, but children pretending to have a girlfriend.
",7
"4th, many inappropriate clothes.
",1
"6th, horrible filter.
",0
"I'm done.
",0
"ROBLOX simply isn't what the media portrays it to be.
",2
"As you know, the media usually is biased, with things left out and such.
",1
"The parents who did publish those articles were simply just uneducated, and never should've let their 8-12 year old children play those games in the first place, and they are the ones completely at fault.
",4
"Those ""child predators"" are 12 year old children trying to get some on an online game, and a couple of clicks to block them should be fine.
",5
"If you are someone like me who has playing ROBLOX since the early days, you know that the community has taken a drastic decline.
",3
"The website (mostly aimed at 8-10 year olds)  faces lots of censorship, and most people do complain about this and make petitions about it.
",8
"This correlates to my 2nd paragraph, describing those articles about child predators.
",2
"ROBLOX needed to improve their image on the media, so they had to rule with an iron fist in terms of censorship.
",0
"Most of the community does not speak, doesn't play the games correctly, and they just don't use common sense anymore.
",2
"WATCH OUT, they are probably all scams as described here: https://gamerzlab.com/roblox-hack-how-to-really-get-free-robux/
",9
"
",0
"I suggest to talk with your kid about this.
",7
"However, it have a lot of perverts here.
",4
"Everybody can build anything they want, and many does perverted things, without they verify anything.
",3
"It have a lot of ODers too, that are spread, and they never ban them.
",2
"And it also have a lot of purchases, bully, i do not recommend it for kids.
",2
"Yesterday, my daughter's account was banned for 7 days claiming she had made unauthorized charges.
",0
"They filed the charges as unauthorized.
",0
"Without even contacting US, the PARENTS, Roblox opted to automatically close her account without giving anybody a chance to explain.
",9
"My Family friend contacted Roblox AND paypal and explained it was an accidental charge and he was not worried about it and did not want her Roblox account to be closed as we had STUPIDLY dumped money into A VIDEO GAME...
",0
"
",0
"Roblox didn't give a crap, they closed the account anyways and I am now out money because they can't remotely contact the account owner for an explanation or even to try to come to settle any of this.
",5
"I'm so angry...Thank you Roblox for stealing money from me
",6
"There is also a chat bar where people can chat together, this can cause trouble.
",1
"I don’t recommend 6 year olds playing though.
",4
"I had one experience where a girl chased me around and was performing and attempting inappropriate acts (examples: humping, kissing, licking, etc.).
",0
"After I had contacted them to delete her account, they are telling me they cannot do it.
",0
"The community takes the fun out of EVERYTHING.
",2
"Half the community is oders, people who think they're cool, and bully others, trollers, just jerks in general, and the other half is just scammers.
",2
"Another thing is the rude language and some people blacklisting through the chat filters, which isn't that bad but the rude language could be fixed.
",1
"The thing is you CAN'T because roblox doesn't even read their reports.
",2
"I've been a roblox member for just about 10 years, and I am not pleased with how it has turned out.
",2
"Honestly, the games on roblox aren't that bad unless you look up inappropriate stuff in the games category.
",1
"One thing I have a problem is the scammers.
",2
"They try to steal your account by telling you to go to some website to get free robux.
",5
"And it's spammed throughout EVERY comment section I see!
",4
"I wish roblox would start looking through item comment sections and at least try to delete some!
",4
"And I have seen mods and admins online roblox to at least delete a few scammers down there.
",2
"Overall, honestly awful and disappointing.
",2
"The games are good, the mods are terrible, the community is toxic and the items in catalog are good but forcing you into buying robux and BC.
",2
"I have repeatedly reported a game on roblox called ATLANTIS NIGHTCLUB that is allowing harassment,hate speech,online dating,discrimination and bullying and nothing has been done about it despite the proof i sent to them.
",9
"Soccer moms have no clue, if it was 18 + they will lose more than half the community.
",6
"These ""inappropiate things"" are exploits, half of them cost money.
",9
"They arent enough persons to ban all hackers in 1 day.
",9
"Exploiters are in all games oh and all games will have sex in it its called R34 shut up oh and just take away their iPad you retards oh me post on facebook me child have sex in game halp me xdd let me ruin roblocks xdddddddd
",5
"July 2018; Roblox was hacked and a little girls character was gang raped.
",0
"People are constantly trying to jailbreak the app to get free robux.
",5
"The games have terrible themes anyway so not a fan and no longer let my boys play it.
",6
"Roblox was poorly moderated and we chose to close our sons' accounts.
",0
"We had to e-mail the company--there is no cancel account or delete account feature.
",0
"However, instead of canceling the accounts, Roblox sent  several follow up e-mails with incorrect information, reminding me that only a parent can cancel the account.
",3
"I have yet to have my request completed.
",9
"Edited to add: Roblox sent an email saying they would delete the account only if I could provide the pin number for the very first game card redeemed for the account.
",5
"This is a ridiculous requirement.
",8
"Honesty this game is a mess, my son (who is 8 years old) got into ""ROBLOX"" when one of his best-friend show him the game.
",0
"I thought the website was fill with heartless, friendly, innocent people, but boy I was wrong.
",0
"I then told my son to delete his best-friend on ROBLOX.
",0
"The next week I caught him doing some disgusting acts to another boy, my son was at this dance club on ROBLOX blackmailing a boy to suck on his ""penis"".
",0
"I immediately closed the computer and ground him for 5 months.
",0
"Please parents, watch over your kids and don't get him or her into these kind of territory's.
",0
"However the amount of vulgar language I see and references that are used by other kids is completely unacceptable.
",8
"And unfortunately reporting doesn't do anything and these moderators (at least the ones I've dealt with) were prejudice and banned me for no reason.
",0
"So there was someone who was ranting about their political beliefs, and personally I don't think stuff like that belongs in a kids game for other children to see and be exposed to.
",5
"I tried to politely tell the person that they shouldn't be discussing these topics on here, and later that evening I was banned for 3 days for ""hate speech"".
",7
"When I tried to appeal the ban, the moderator told me that I WAS THE ONE AT FAULT here and that what I did was supressing the other person.
",0
"But like I said, there are just certain political and controversial topics that kids shouldn't be exposed to at a young age.
",3
"Aside from that issue, there are a lot of instances where kids are recreating sexual acts.
",1
"For all we know there could be child predators posing as kids, and if you are a parent who's reading this, please make sure your child is using a 12 you and under account, which has increased privacy and will protect your child from this garbage, but overall, it's just best if you didn't let your child play Roblox.
",7
"I see Online Dater all the time and its un safe to online date.
",7
"Not like some game that tell kids to kill and be violent.
",3
"But after that, there are problems.
",2
"First, robux is cheap, but here is the problem.
",2
"My cousin said that ROBLOX ripped his family off by making I’m pay more for robux then the usual.
",0
"And since they have removed tix, there have been numerous games that have a gravestone of tix in it because roblox had removed tix and I believe this is so that people can’t get anymore free robux and are greedy in money for people buy robux, and I am not buying any robux.
",6
"But I have one problem.
",0
"Now for the configuring page, I have just one problem... WHY DO YOU FILTER MY TEXT.
",5
"THERE IS NO CURSING IN THE TEXT, NO PERSONAL INFORMATION AND NOTHING INAPPROPRIATE.
",0
"So in conclusion, Roblox can be fun in all BUT IT HAS PROBLEMS.
",2
"By the way, I am not an adult and it says so for some reason.
",0
"Also, there are a lot of people who are not kids, hacking the game and saying bad words.
",2
"For example, if you tried to say something bad, it would turn the word to hashtags : ######
",1
"It even hashtags out numbers, so kids can't giver out their age.
",5
"P.S There are also some violent game where you shoot people and some blood appears.
",3
"Roblox isn't a bad website, but isn't a good website, While in game remember this...
",2
"It is common to meet exploiters, trolls, and hackers.
",2
"and Some places/games in Roblox will be inappropriate for your kids in some way and some games will be inappropriate in ways you wouldn't think your child would see.
",1
"(Note: The Place will get banned after numerous reports about the place is headed to them) and The Community has bad parts, I did say it's good but only some parts.
",6
"and Roblox during 2013 used to be free, and Yes, Their was monetization but it uses to be an option, but now, if see a roblox game that is good (BLOXBURG) you have to pay for it, and the youtube community about this website is horrible but many channels are good about roblox like Epikrika, KonokeKitten, MrObviou.... Ah.. Never Mind that..............
",9
" 
",0
"Also Remember there is no way of getting free robux
",6
"
",0
"So is it a good website and my saying is Yes but remember this, You will see in a common day on ROBLOX, 
",0
"When chat is enabled, the 14-16 year olds tend to abuse it and speak nasty language by misspelling or using placeholder words to say adult/substance/voilent related topics.
",1
"The Roblox moderation team is great, but they are also greatly outnumbered, so it's difficult to be perfect.
",6
"Recently, Roblox has not been that great of a platform in the eyes of many.
",2
"Violence:
",0
"Roblox has several genres of violent games such as first person shooters, murder, Russian roulette, horror, battle royale, zombies, heists, and if you are able to go deeper into the site, you can even find torture and suicide games on the site.
",8
"Sex:
",0
"Although you cannot find this genre of games particularly normally, there are several games that have been infested with such terrible content, but have been taken down.
",6
"Content like this come in the form of exploits (as mentioned earlier in the review) which are not related to the Roblox company.
",9
"There are also online communities that are dedicated to making Roblox pornography, which again, none of this content comes from Roblox themselves and these people are not affiliated with the company.
",2
"As you can see in many other reviews, the lists have been abused to the point where you can no longer use certain letters, words or numbers due to them sounding similar to inappropriate words.
",1
"No player should join any of the websites that are being promoted, as again, none of these website are directly affiliated or sponsored by the Roblox company in any way.
",1
"If you input your password in any of these games/websites, you run the risk of having your current currency spent or transferred, your e-mail and password being changed or have your account banned doing something you did not do.
",5
"This game contains content in which you may not feel comfortable viewing or have your child viewing.
",4
"I have reported them and nothing happened.
",0
"Roblox targets kids and completely lacks moderation.
",9
"This company is disgusting.
",5
"There is games you can even play due the the bullying and harrassment.
",3
"Roblox should be SUED for targeting our children, cause they absolute lack of moderation subjects our kids to porn!
",4
"You have to buy crap for up to $99.99 which is ridiculous.
",6
"common sense media thinks roblox has sex but it doesnt roblox is for kids all ages and should not be demonitised
",2
"Roblox support is virtually non-existent for parents.
",6
"I had issues with Roblox and my kids and needed to resolve a few things.
",0
"As a parent without an account I had no way to contact Roblox.
",6
"There is a lot of sexual content and mean players in it who get triggered if you say the wrong thing or wear a shirt with something that they don't like on it.
",9
"Every player on the game is very judgmental and competitive with one another.
",5
"Many of the children on the game dress inappropriately and the parents of the child's account don't know that online they are acting like a completely different person who has sex virtually at such a young age or talks and dates strangers who they don't even know.
",4
"I'd recommend this game to a parent who wants to moderate and watch every move their child makes because there are many pedophiles and perverts on the game.
",7
"It also makes your child learn about bad things at such a young age and I learned this through experience because I've been playing it since 2013.
",7
"Also, robux and builders club these days is such a waste of money and I wouldn't recommend spending a penny because in a year your child will eventually quit the game.
",6
"most people overreact to this game sure roblox dont ban hackers but itsa game for any age heck some of the games even have age restrictions so please dont overreact i play roblox myself and there is a game with a bit of blood that is on the main page its called ro ghoul and its about the player being a ghoul and having to kill humans and absorbing them when the player hits somone with their sword (kagune) there is a small cloud of blood and they changed the eating animation from eating the human to absorbin
",4
"Roblox has no swear words, but sadly, some other players think otherwise to that.
",1
"Other adult reviews are making reviews about other players being older and try to get past the filter system saying profanity, or even hacking the chat system.
",1
"This has NOTHING to do with Roblox, but I would say ROBLOX needs to actually be more strict with them instead of not reading report reviews most of the time.If a parent is reading this, PLEASE tell you child the following: 1. do NOT give any private information, including the least concern, which is age.
",7
"2. do NOT fall for the ""free robux"" scams, as this will take any robux on your account, or even take your account itself.
",5
"(if this happens, contact Roblox immediately.
",6
"3. leave games quickly if something looks odd in the game such as deleted parts, different images, etc.
",3
"this means the game got hacked by a hacker, or maybe the hacker is still even in the game.
",0
"those strangers may be hackers or may be above 18 years of age.
",7
"ROBLOX does ban players that don't follow the terms of services, so don't worry about that.
",2
"If one sees another doing something inappropriate or whatnot, you can even report them, but this is optional.
",7
"I'm sending a message to other kids, please listen.It's too easy to forget that robux cost REAL money and will get billed to the card on file (aka your parents).
",9
"Take it from me, I did it and I lost my mom's trust.
",0
"I take responsibility for my actions, but the game developers know kids can and want robux, and they should make it harder to get.
",7
"4 months later I still haven't paid my mom back for all the charges and I still don't have my xbox back.
",0
"But  the worst part is that I lost and still haven't earned her trust back which makes me feel lousy.It wasn't worth it, take it from me .
",6
"This is part of what makes it fun and unique, but also what makes it dangerous for children and teens.
",2
"It is a fact widely acknowledged by long-time players that, over the years, Roblox has slowly evolved from an outlet for creativity into an exploitative, poorly-moderated, cash-grabbing heap of rubbish.
",2
"Unfortunately, players who do not purchase robux are frequently harassed by other players and denounced as “noobs.” In many cases, the games themselves are spammed with shop links and game passes which encourage the player to spend robux for useless upgrades.
",9
"My greatest concern, however, is with the poorly-moderated and negligent administration.
",5
"On Roblox, users can purchase Nazi uniforms, or similarly inappropriate user-generated attire, with no consequence.
",5
"The profanity filter is commonly and easily bypassed by users, so your child may witness excessive profanity, sexting, and similar vulgarities both in-game and in private chat.
",3
"My niece and nephew, for instance, have each been solicited by random perverts on roleplaying games.
",5
"From my experience, Roblox’s profanity filter mirrors the current state of the app itself; it is unnecessarily strict for many harmless words, while ignoring the real problems.
",1
"There is a moderation system in place, but it is poorly managed, to say the least.
",1
"Many reports go unnoticed, so many offences go unpunished.
",6
"I have reported bullying, profanity, sexual “online dating,” and hate speech on numerous occasions — most were ignored.
",3
"I have reported hate groups affiliated with Nazism and white supremacy — all were ignored.
",5
"I have reported users with inappropriate profiles (including, in one instance, Nazi propaganda and a “Heil Hitler”) — and all were ignored.
",0
"I have reported well-known sexually-based games and popular hangouts which allow uncensored music — and all were ignored.
",4
"If you want my honest opinion: yes, Roblox CAN be fun and positive, but it is ruined by rampant corruption, consumerism, inadequate moderation, and horribly inappropriate content.
",0
"It appears Roblox has been having issues with filtering content, and users have made a game if subverting those filters, posting violent or sexual content and using substitute swear words.
",1
"You should keep children offline with Roblox, or simply not use it, because Roblox is not enforcing kid safe policies well.
",7
"This game should not be for kids specially under 12.
",2
"Too much violence, kids will learn less positivity  but more negativity from this game.
",2
"We should not allow to play this game to kids.
",7
"Although the characters and the gameplay has a Minecraft feel this platform is far from kid-friendly.
",1
"I was horrified to find out some of the games my 8-year-old had been playing contained sexual content.
",0
"This game is a ticking time bomb and not safe for kids!
",1
"There was people referencing alcohol and drug usage and doing sex acts and using dirty language.
",1
"Never ever ever play this game.
",4
"THIS IS NOT TRUE AND IS VERY DECEPTIVE.
",0
"Only private messaging is limited--communication with ANYONE playing the game is available at all times, just not private, leading to a much greater privacy risk than we had anticipated.
",6
"While she enjoys the game, she has also experienced (to our dismay) her first online bullying due to this inability to control who interacts with her.
",0
"Also, many of the games within Roblox are more violent than we had expected from a platform that markets itself for children.
",4
"Some users are even attaching ""particles"" that blast audio bits or visual images that are sometimes pornographic.
",3
"This is not allowed but it can happen before the game shuts it down.
",8
"Which brings me to my last issue: Our experience with Roblox customer service has been truly one of the worst I have ever seen.
",6
"I exchanged multiple messages and each time got a reply from a different person, and even after six or seven replies from different people, there was no interest in helping with a relatively simple question--how to reset a lost password.
",0
"They would not allow her to do this through the password reset button because we did not have a credit card on file, even when I offered to add one through customer service and to verify her account ownership by answering any questions they wanted to ask (list of friends, device IP, recent logins, etc).
",6
"Now my daughter cannot ever log out of the game or she loses everything she has created in the game.
",0
"I cannot believe that she is the only young child who has forgotten a password and does not have an open credit card attached to her account.
",7
"When I pointed out that the question had  not been answered even though I had politely asked each of the 6 or 7 people for help, I got the reply that ""we cannot help you with this issue.""
",9
"Very disappointing.
",0
"We feel a little scammed between the lack of actual security provided to the children's communication and the inability to provide a simple service like a password reset without a previously associated credit card.
",9
"Several of my mom friends and I agree that letting our kids have it is one of our biggest regrets in terms of parenting decisions.
",7
"Honestly as a person who actively plays Roblox  I personally believe that if your child is under the age of 13 parents shouldn't allow their kids to play.
",7
"It has people who act very idiotic and say inappropriate things or commit inappropriate actions.
",1
"The Roblox censor system is very bad so alot of kids can replace or add letters to be able to say the word.
",1
"For example, the word fuck, they could say ""fvck"" .
",1
"Also, don't waste your money on the games currency also known as ""Robux""; it's a waste and the currency gets spent fast.
",6
"I definitely think there are great things to this game, but there are many problems.. One is the influx of teenagers thinking that they're cool by attempting to bypass the swear filter (and succeeding).
",1
"Not only that, it is too easy for kids to grab a credit card and spend all the money they want with little to no verification on purchases.
",6
"There are also a few games on here that represent sexual acts (which ARE in fact usually removed, but not quick enough.)
",1
"and games that involve a lot of weaponry and murder.
",8
"While there are many innocent games, the violent ones definitely should make Roblox bump up their minimum age limit.
",8
"Sometimes stupid pop-ups appear like: Kicked by server or LOST GAME ID.
",1
"THEY'RE SO USELESS AND POINTLESS.
",0
"Some games do not save data and and when ""kicked by server'"" pops-up IT RUINS EVERYTHING.
",2
"DONT EVEN BOTHER TRYING SUCH GAMES ON THIS STUPID COMMUNITY.
",0
"None of the stuff us bad stuff that says porn is only there because of fake websites and viruses if there is any it get deleted immediately and the swearing is censored.
",8
"or its costs money to play it without money the company would go bankrupt.
",6
"But furthermore, most of these games don't even function properly, so you are plagued by a child running up to you every 30 seconds saying, ""Why doesn't this work?""
",4
"I would NOT consider this kid friendly whatsoever, especially since there is nothing rating the interactions in these chatrooms/worlds/""games.""
",2
"Some of the games are ok,  the others are very violent.
",2
"I just banned my daughter recently after I found she was playing a game where you run around with knife and keep stabbing others.
",0
"Secondly there is a history of online daters who date on roblox, in which they don't care about.
",8
"If their so called ""Report Abuse"" button worked, then there would not be a petition to remove a single individual user on roblox.
",0
"He has been exposed on youtube to be one of those unholy things.
",4
"As a parent and guardian of two children who plays on Roblox, I highly recommend avoiding this game at all means.
",4
"They  will not handle your situation in time, professionally, and they will just read off their script on customer service.
",7
"Their virtual items are too expensive and you might be scammed on that game by malicious users.
",6
"From what I have heard, they also have the mannerism to terminate you in the most unfair way.
",6
"This game is anything but safe.
",2
"EDIT: Roblox will also side with these pedophiles.
",1
"But then we started to notice how the chat feature, and images in games started to turn vulgar and explicit.
",6
"Reporting does not work, in essence, because they are apparently inundated with reports.
",1
"And though some parent groups have volunteered to help in moderating for on-the-spot bans, they have been refused.
",3
"The problem is persistent, and is not being resolved.
",2
"This is, in my opinion, not a good game for any age, but definitely not for young kids.
",4
"I would skip it.
",3
"This is my first problem; the prices are outrageous.
",9
"I looked at some cosmetic items and in game items and saw how everything was way overpriced, but this is not my only complaint.
",0
"My child began to talk and act differently; he began to swear and act violently toward me and others.
",0
"I was afraid something happened at school but, no, it wasn't that.
",0
"It was that game; it ruined my child.
",0
"I looked into it and saw violent shooters and stuff that had KILLING AND MURDER.
",0
"We being believers in God, I immediately spanked my child for being so disrespectful and restricted his use of the computer, and if he did need it i would need to be supervising.
",9
"Sorry it says i'm and adult, I honestly don't know how to change it.
",5
"I do warn parents and families that the community isn't the best.
",2
"Stay away from roleplaying games like ""Boy And Girls Dance Club"" or ""Robloxian High School.
",8
"And for parents overreacting calling us ""toxic players"" we are far from that.
",0
"my son die
",0
"I know a lady whose daughter was invited into a room and the characters were doing all kinds of sexual acts.
",0
"Do not let your kids play this game.
",7
"This game hosts a toxic player base, violent games, and is a money trap.
",6
"The kids use the chat to talk inappropriately and can be very mean to each other.
",1
"There is quite a bit of cyber bulling and it can be difficult for kids (even ones that have been educated about internet safety) to avoid getting roped into doing unsafe things or giving out identifying information.
",7
"I think that this is a bad thing though, because the child will be tempted to sneak back on and play without permission.
",4
"Since I couldn't delete the account that was made without parental permission, I got on it and changed the password, username, and avatar, and removed everyone on the account's friend list because it was the closest I could get to deleting it.
",0
"I highly recommend not letting your children play Roblox as it is unsafe, is a potential breeding  ground for predators, is highly addictive for young kids, and is like a virus because you can't get rid of it.
",3

",6
"The community.There are many bullies out there  and there is no player that was not a victim.Warning: all these three years that i was playing roblox, roblox did nothing to stop them.Moreover, there are dangerous people who steal personal info.

"3.Online Dating(OD).ODing is a huge drawback of roblox.There are players who do some inappropriate acts(REALLY INAPPROPRIATE ACTS) and hangout like they 'know' each other ending up giving personal info.
",1
"There are soooo many disadvantages i want to write down but they are countless and i cannot keep typing forever.

"For all parents I have just one thing to say:Do not allow your children who are under 10 to play this game.I have only 2 close friends and play games only for fun.

"Recently, the forums were shut down permanently because of a you-tuber called quackityHQ.
",0
"He got his fans (mostly children and pre-teens) to spam the forums and get the mods and admins to un-ban him.
",0
"The player-base has some individuals who constantly call me noob, or ugly.
",1
"But remember to tell your children ""free robux"" sites are fake and potentially dangerous.
",7
"If you can't afford to spend real money prepared to be called a 'noob' and be constantly made fun of by so-called pros (who usually buy and dress in the most expensive and 'cool' clothing)  and at times you even get singled out just because of your appearance.
",4
"It's messed up and I feel like the game developers are money-hungry,  why else would the only accessible way to get Robux is to spend your hard-earned money in order to customise your character, buy fun stuff and unlock cool features in this game.
",4
"They don't even offer daily logins to get them,  or watch videos or do surveys to get them.
",6
"But the worst part of all is the bullies - many 7-12 year olds are exposed to the negativity and I think the company should really do something to minimise the bullying.
",4
"ROBLOX is a great starter game, but I noticed they were taking off models and decals from me because they were inappropriate.

"This is RUDE and there is NO inappropriate things in the item.
",1
"It's just ROBLOX's fault.
",7
"Beware the shooting games and the online dating and there are hashtags.

"I also hate that we need real money for ROBUX.

"If for some reason they remove an item from their catalog, it is like throwing it away.

"You cannot get the item back and they will not refund the Robux ($).
",0
"Their customer support is less than helpful.
",6
"They do have violent games sometimes.
",3
"This was my main issue with it, being that they could chat with any player they came across.
",0
"I also saw a few people mention about their kids being called a ""noob"" because they didn't buy in game money, but turning off chat fixes that.

"However, without chat, it just simply makes them look strange.

"My child loaded the app , the next thing we know is we are being charged $55 for something we surely did NOT authorize.

"Thus in turn having a wide selection of games to play that children love to explore but most are extremely crude and non polished to the point of being almost unplayable.

"You will see some good designed games out there but the trash far outweighs the good.
",2
"With this type of environment will come the eventual child breakdown , crying, anger, full blown meltdowns as they get stuck in geometry, get stuck because again it’s a crudely designed game by amateur game designers, have their points not register, and fave griefing from other players whose sole focus is to annoy the other players.
",1
"The list of things that will go wrong while playing this game could go on for much longer then I can write.
",5
"Your children will be exposed to violent games that users create that replicate figures such as Freddy , Jason, creepy pasta figures, and so on.
",1
"There is also a high emphasis of designing non sensical games on popular internet memes, some of which are not appropriate for children under the age of comprehension of what satire means.
",3
"I believe that this game has to much violence !
",2
"Roblux is plagued with security flaws and scammers who are constantly trying to take advantage of your children.

"Because of this, I used the two step verification, and still the account got hacked.

"Any programmer can tell you that the whole app is poorly designed.

"I have reluctantly and carefully let my children play Roblox and although they SOMETIMES got excited and had fun, they also get horribly distraught over getting ripped off (seriously, I've spent lots of money and games have stolen their ""robux"" money)  and get they have gotten repeatedly  bullied by other players.

"It is a nightmare I wish I never started.

"That doesn't make make money off of children or their unwilling parents though.

"Roblox might have bad stuff but it is easy to avoid.
",2
"And I did lie about age.
",0
"ROBLOX was never intended for kids.
",6
"I don't understand why people say ROBLOX is a kids game.
",4
"The worst things are that ROBLOX administrators don't monitor the platform much.
",3
"It also has robux, which is a waste of money.
",6
"There are also many games with violence and guns such as BLOODFEST, but players can choose what to play.
",3
"Some games are under the radar and have 18+ things, which is a bad thing.
",8
"Even though they get banned a lot, they're still there.
",9
"As a player of ROBLOX alongside my nephew, I highly dislike the fact ROBLOX is censoring the most stupidest words ever, some people can't type out numbers or even put the actual number, and they can't even say certain words, and the words I cannot say are of course the numbers and these few words: ""Friend"" ""Parent"" ""Guardian"" and ""Guide"" like, it's getting to the point where it's becoming another game called ""Wizard 101"" (Which I have played before and found it fun, but censorship is again bad.)

"The one thing that I would have to complain about is how difficult it is to get your account back, if hacked or lost.
",7
"This is a big problem that many people face as usually, most people throw the game card out after it has been used, as it has been rendered useless, but  without that or no other information on the account that can be used to verify your ownership of the account, they will not assist you any further and will close the case.

"Dont let your kids play this.

"My child faked his age to get on this game, stole a credit card to purchase items on the game.

"I informed the company and still did nothing.

"DD was in tears that her friend would think she was bullying her, so I texted the mom and both girls got off it asap.
",0
"I looked into the app more this morning and see that there are all kinds of inappropriate layers hidden in this game that aren't initially evident to parents.
",2
"Sexual content, bad language, *a lot* of bullying, behavior that looks like grooming, and hackers even changing parts of a child's world, similar to my daughter's name change.
",1
"(I read a review where one girl's kitten wallpaper was changed by a hacker to depict sex acts.)
",0
"And, finally, worlds that are all about killing and violence.
",1
"While my daughter has no interest in that type of game, it's far too accessible.
",0
"(pretty dumb of me) A lot of the content went over DD's head and she simply had no idea what was there.

"It's scary what I found.

"It appears that the Admin monitoring on Roblox is now non-existent.
",8
"But, There is currently the ''report'' system which doesn't do anything.
",3
"Or it has been worse.
",6
"Roblox has currently ''Safe chat'' which is not a good thing.
",3
"They should un-tag the words.
",7
"There is a lot of online daters on Roblox, which Roblox doesn't take care of.
",2
"Roblox doesn't have the best Moderation.
",1
"They ban or warn people for a ''non valid'' reason.
",2
"The customer service is bad.
",6
"Really bad.
",0
"But Roblox always goes against the Community.
",8
"Bad Moderation.
",0
"False Advertising.
",0
"I think you parents are plain wrong.
",2
"I saw my child watching a video by a person named Skeleton Reality or something along the lines of that making fun of parents giving bad reviews.

"There is some violence, but not too much.
",2
"It’s just a skin colored LEGO man.
",5
"No private parts, unless someone is hacking (1 out of 1000th chance) And also, the “My ### hurts.” It’s just ROBLOXS way to censor bad words.
",1
"Do NOT let your child play Phantom Forces!!
",7
"It has guns and blood.
",3
"It’s not the games fault there are pedophiles!
",2
"Stop posting idiotic reviews on this GOOD game...
",5
"They also removed free currency “Tix or Tickets” just so people could buy Robux.
",6
"Sex happens but there’s no private parts which is bad.
",2
"ALSO DO NOT PLAY RAISE A BABY.
",0
"The hackers aren't even hackers, they're just people who happened to convince your child to give them personal info.. which does not constitute hacking at all.
",4
"You should warn your child about these people and tell them to not give any passwords, or anything that they can work with to harm them..
",7
"There is no such thing as a real safety monitoring, it does not required parent permission, a kid can just create an account without any email/phone confirmation.
",5
"User content can be inappropriate .
",1
"I've seen games where chat is just open for anyone to write whatever they want, no signs of a moderator ... and finally most of the content is low value just focused on grabbing kids attention but with no real challenge, learning or anything that makes a good game for kids ... or a good game in general.

"My son had found a very inappropriate video made on roblox by my daughter and others.
",0
"When I went to the computer and saw the video I was mortified.
",0
"My daughter and “friends” were naked men with large penises sexually going after another bent over naked man character.
",0
"I had no idea this was possible, and add to the fact that they were dared or as I look at coerced into doing something they knew was wrong and inappropriate.
",0
"I know roblox is now banned in my home.

"a bad app
",2
"My 12 Year old son now paces all the time, masturbates in school as he thinks about Roblox, and tries to act like his favorite ""knight guy"" and now attacks me with his cardboard sword at 3 in the morning.

"Please don't for your sake let your child use this game.
",7
"My child is now hated in school only has friends on Roblox and averages a d+ in school.

"I try to stop him but he takes his laptop back and attacks me if I try it again.

"I once turned the wifi off for a day and he bite my computer and threw it out the window.

"He is a constant challenge that harasses our cat while he has great temper tantrums.
",9
"Please Please don't let your child get this game it will be the end for your child's normal life
",7
"This game is full of microtransactions and has sexual material and child predators and there are people who are gonna ask you wanna be my girlfriend/boyfriend just don't get this game
",8
"Why you ask, it is extremely inappropriate, innocent children, like my sister who is under the age of 8, was asked repeatedly to imitate sexual actions, do other nasty things like remove all articles of clothing, and ask friends to do the same.
",0
"I was disgusted by this, and there were many other things that make this game horrible.
",0
"There are drugs that are also given out by the kids, which I think is horrid that kids are being exposed to this.
",1
"Spoiled rats, the bullies of Roblox, brag about robux, and make others feel bad about themselves.
",7
"They abuse and harass other players which is unacceptable, their parents should be notified by their actions!!
",8
"Some kids swear and curse, and make fun of others who don't.
",1
"Younger kids who don't understand any of this, soon start to speak these words in their daily life.
",6
"If you agree, tell others to get rid of Roblox, and teach their kids a life lesson!!
",7
"Any game that rewards killing police and robbing banks is not for kids, or anyone else for that matter.
",7
"All you people that are saying bad stuff about ROBLOX, well, that's because there are hackers.
",2
"Also, not all ROBLOX games are bad just because one is.
",2
"Yes, we need better anti-exploit scripts.
",6
"But no, we don't need to be dissing ROBLOX for something that's not even their fault.
",7
"And the swearing, ROBLOX hashtags it, unless you can change the message.
",1
"It's not surprising that kids indulge in 'bad behavior' when they can.
",6
"As a kid, I certainly cursed whenever parents weren't around.
",2
"But in this anonymous environment, it is constant nastiness  daring people to 'hug' + 'kiss' alongside constant  threats to kill.
",9
"Kill 10 players by punching them
",1
"OK, I understand that may be mild in the world of video games today, I am simply providing context that the 'nasty' tone of the pl.ayers can be echoed in the games themselves
",3
"One player in the high school game was calling women 'b-----s' and 'wh---s' and threaening them.
",0
"There is a function to report abuse--but that particular players name was unavailable to report--no idea why--other names were listed and available to report.
",4
"All in all, I had a very short visit in two games--and found it rather demoralizing.
",0
"The wild west internet is NOT a place to nourish young minds and hearts.
",2
"This is the worst game I have ever seen.
",6
"I know Counter-strike, I know GTA but this is worse.
",2
"Ok, your kid shouldn’t be able to get it on his/her computer, so until you buy them this game it shouldn’t be dangerous.
",7
"And now to the worse a single hacker can get onto your kid’s tablet a big picture of porn or whatever he likes.
",0
"And if he meets a child predator he can get some info from your kid if your kid isn’t careful enough.
",7
"I looked to their inventory what they have bought and it was a RADIO into a game called “murder mystery” where is one murderer one detective and innocents and murderer must kill everyone, thats a game for 8 YO KIDS?!
",0
"That was a total waste of money.
",6
"Don’t do the same mistakes as I did please.
",9
"This game is obviously by the devil, it is pure evil.
",0
"I have grounded my son for 5 years for mentioning such a name and saying such a vile word.
",0
"This game promotes terrorism and is filled with sex predators.
",6
"Some say they're just 12-year-olds saying curse words, but I say they are sex predators, because only sex predators would swear like that!
",1
"I teach in an Elementary school and my 2nd graders report A LOT of inappropriate chat going on.
",7
"You're another worried parent who probabky doesn't trust your kid.
",4
"Roblox is run by scam artists.
",5
"My son's account was compromised by a hacker and when we tried to get the account back, the administrators made it impossible to verify ownership of the account.
",0
"The card was discarded once redeemed as it seemed useless, but obviously not.
",0
"I believe they make it purposely difficult to gain access to your account as it will force you to create a new one and spend more money.
",7
"With the poor admin assistance, poor in-game moderation of abuse and over all lack of anything remotely child friendly, I would steer clear of this game altogether!
",9
"Roblox is a dangereous game, i will tell everything that you need to be aware about roblox, this comes from a roblox veteran.
",7
"First,
",0
"Roblox is full of Online Daters, you may ask what this means.
",7
"Next thing is that the moderating system is horrible, censors things that should not be censored and doesn't take down things that should.
",1
"Sadly, it doesn't work.
",0
"The game has an bad community, for example: Online Daters, Bullies, and bad people in general.
",1
"Next item is pedophiles.
",6
"Roblox is pedophiles's favorite game.
",2
"Be very cautious, the chances are low, but pedophiles can sometimes meet kids in real life.
",2
"The ""Safe"" chat censors things that shouldn't be censored and can be easily bypassed.
",1
"Next is scammers.
",2
"Scammers are people that claim they will give you ""1 million free robux"", which is obviously a scam.
",8
"When people get scammed, they can lose their accounts or even worse: get a virus.
",6
"If they lose their accounts, they lose everything they had on that account: Robux, BC(I will explain these paid items later), Badges, etc.
",6
"Not only that they are overpriced, for example: you just bought 22,500 robux(U$199.99)for your child and then that's where the overpriced items come in, in the next day, you find out your child used all their robux on one, pointless item.
",7
"A waste of money.
",6
"BC has good advantages, but, again, it's overpriced.
",2
"Next is bullies.
",2
"Next is bad updates.
",2
"For example, forums, the forums used to help alot, but now they removed it.
",0
"Next is violent and inappropriate games, Well, you know, people can make their own games, so that means they can remain a long time undiscovered in the thousands of games that roblox has.
",4
"Inappropriate games like having sex, etc.
",3
"There is MUCH more bad things about roblox.
",2
"You can keep up with the bad things that roblox is doing in the youtube channel greenlegocats123.
",3
"No, this is not advertising.
",2
"This game has resently outlawed in our home.
",6
"It’s extremely addicting, cause antisocial behavior,  affects ability to keep time and I believe was very damaging to our 10 yr old son.
",0
"His personality changed, he began lying and sneaking time to play.
",6
"They absolute worst decision was inviting it into our home and life.
",9
"100x worse than Minecraft.
",8
"This game is also VERY expensive.
",8
"Upgrades are available for real money but the exchange rate is way off.
",6
"The chat feature is also concerning.
",1
"Many people asking for login info and trying to scam others.
",5
"So obsessive!

"I am a kid,But I do not recommend this to you parents.When I was new at first which I didnt have a thing called ""robux"" Which roblox makes you buy like 450 for 4.95,Anyways I went onto these disturbing games like ""Adopt and raise a cute kid"" ""Roblox High School"" And just got disturbed and bullied on it of apparently me being a ""bacon hair"" Which just terribly offended me and while i was young at the time I started crying so I rilly dont recommend to other children,But when I did buy robux I started making f
",0
"Just definetly dont get this.
",7
"also the only way to find not kid friendly games is to search them i know this because i look at recommendations and front page games only.
",4
"ignore them if you get asked out in game say no simple as that.
",7
"Really inappropriate, sensors all numbers but not the curse words.
",1
"To many online daters, the games are not fun.
",8
"Toooooo much lag!
",2
"I alwaz get scarred.
",5
"The game is child friendly and the only thing wrong is that on the t&c's say online daters will be banned and they never do.
",2
"So far, this ""company"" has made $82.90 worth of unauthorizaed charges on my account.
",6
"They won't tell me when the charges happen and so far, they're talking in circles to avoid giving me my money back.
",0
"So, I had to pay my bank to stop any future FALSE transactions from them and now I have to cancel my debit card and get a new one all because these people are crooks.
",8
"Whatever you do, DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFO.
",7
"As I grew, I don’t see Roblox as a family friendly game.
",5
"Not only you have to pay to actually have fun, most of the things are overpriced.
",8
"When it comes to overpriced items that cost over 100,000 robux, that would cost about $10,000 of real money.
",6
"Even if you choose not to pay, your child may be stumbling across being bullied and being made fun of for your look.
",5
"If someone is being harassed, betrayed, or oppressed online, the Roblox moderation team couldn’t care less.
",3
"They do nothing.
",7
"Why is it so addictive?
",6
"The most thing children get angry about is the fact that Roblox would censor most of the things they say.
",1
"People do inappropriate things on Roblox.
",1
"It’s not that Roblox is making these games that involve sex and violence.
",8
"This game is highly known for online dating, bullying, and inappropriate content.
",1
"Mostly that Roblox removes things that everyone loves.
",8
"One tiny movement can cause an accident.
",2
"There’s also so many scams on Roblox that seem too good to be true.
",2
"They lore your child into putting in their passwords and expecting “free robux” but instead getting their accounts hacked.
",7
"I've only ever let them play it with the chat setting turned off and have told them never to accept a friend request from someone they don't know.
",7
"I'm not even sure how this happened but this is just the last straw for me.
",9
"Most of these parties have scantily clad block women dancing to songs with misogynistic themes and inappropriate lyrics (curses are bleeped out but there are still sexually suggestive lyrics).
",7
"Avoid this game.
",2
"If a user's account is detected to be under the age of 13, ROBLOX automatically filters words such as ""idiot"", ""crap"", etc.
",1
"shooter games, robbery games, etc.
",7
"This game looks like it’s for kids but it’s not!
",3
"A 7 year old was playing and told me they had seen people having sex regularly and also oral sex too :(  apparently having sex was one of the challenges in the game.
",0
"I'm sorry, but when a kid has to see the most inappropriate image I've ever seen, I'm done.
",9
"Seriously, this is not for kids.
",4
"13+ account with access to very very adult content in a supposedly innocuous game.
",5
"I don't care how fun it is, kids shouldn't be exposed to that.
",7
"People can hack the game and have things pop up you can't un-see.
",5
"I have been playing ROBLOX for about a year and a half, and I know thats not very long, but i have seen some pretty bad things on the game (sadly).
",2
"ROBLOX itself isn't a bad game, but its the community and some of the moderators that don't do their job correctly, some players are found hacking and admin abusing other players, and older kids are doing some pretty messed up things.
",1
"Online dating, see it often; many people refer those players as ""Oders"", we have 8 and younger kids online dating to what might be some perverted old men that is you know, catfishing, but the young ones just don't understand....
",4
"I think that spending $200 dollars on fake credit, is retarded, and the prices of buying robux is just absurd.. but here are some good things about roblox- Roblox is a place to make new friends, fun games, dressing up, roleplaying and just having fun like any kid wants to have, at such a young age there is a big world ahead of them, but sometimes its ok to get a break and some fun from school, chores, etc.
",2
"Yet in the ""Violence"" section of the review there is nothing at all listed -""No violence.""
",4
"I would like to suggest that Common Sense Media reconsider the ratings you have given this game.
",4
"As an elementary school teacher I am observer and witness of the frightening violence and potential harm of this game.
",4
"It is truly like sending your unaccompanied child into the world.
",5
"Please reconsider your ratings.
",4
"Far too many teenagers and kids trying to act older than they are.
",4
"The website is far too popular now for its own good and for this reason the staff has trouble moderating it.
",2
"Many of them revolve around getting as much money as possible, dating and shooting each other.
",8
"As a parent I have caught my kid taking part in some very inappropriate activities on the site, and when he tried to avoid them afterwards he was threatened and blackmailed in attempts to get him to continue.
",0
"The parental controls have been all but entirely removed now, so any previous claims of safety should be adjusted to match the current state of things in my opinion.
",1
"Contacting the mods about this did nothing other than get my child banned.
",0
"He dragged her to his house and  blood started spurting everywhere because he was stabbing her.
",0
"She has been VERY upset since it happened.
",6
"Yes there are kids behaving badly like everywhere, use these as teaching times just don’t set them in front of a computer and be unsupervised.
",7
"On several occasions my daughter has tried to log in and she cannot and has been often forced to create a new account.
",0
"This means she has lost the stuff she has accrued.
",0
"I recently tried to get her access back to her account, she was locked out despite not changing her password, and ROBLOX wanted information that did not exist and despite several emails showing screenshots of subscriptions to her account having been paid via ITUNES they refused to acknowledge that we had verified an account of a 9 nine year?
",0
"I consider this site atrocious, it is run by people who do not know what customer service is and seems dodgy to me - VERY disappointed.
",6
"Some of the games are great others are very bad the admins of the website aren’t very good.
",2
"My child struggled to disconnect/unplug from this game.
",4
"Not only were there not stopping points where you could easily save but your levels were lost.
",1
"In addition , her behavior after playing was volatile and disrespectful.
",6
"It appears to be the only banned game in our peer group.
",1
"You use rwal money to buy fake money.
",9
"It has all been fine until the items she buys, goes missing- I dis the normal, reported what happen.
",0
"This is the problem.
",1
"Not what they had that disappered- wether it be from a glitch or a game deletwd within the app by admin.
",6
"So if 5 items go missing, you cannot prove your child bought the item.
",7
"They want a printscreen of the items purchased, but how can you if theres no purchase history, and its not in their inventory.
",6
"They WILL NOT give items back nor refund your money.
",7
"You will get circled statements to your questions and no answers.
",8
"IT was terrible.

"Hello there im going to say is that roblox is not 18+ it is mainly for kids 8 or older and i am going to say is that no i dont think there is ever drugs and drinking and smoking in roblox they dont teach you that they really teach your child how to build or script games that they made and i know there is a bit of games that deal with ""sex"" and cussing like ""Fuck"" by bypassing it but i would tell your child to ignores the things they encounter thru out the site and the scammers are being banned one by one yo

"Horrible game, the email doesnt even respond to you, I've been waiting 13 days and no reply, anyways, lets talk about stuff right now.
",5
"Roblox is a horrible game where children have ""roblox"" sex and bypass the filter to swear, also the prices which are alot bigger than you would expect.
",1
"my review may be for 18 and up but thats because kids dont need to see how bad this game truly is.
",7
"i hate the 8 bit graphics it is trash.
",3
"when i saw my child playing this game i had an epileptic seizure.
",0
"But it's an online game so it includes the following, online bullying, scams, and online sex jokes a few times.
",1
"Plus there is too much consumerism.
",2
"If you hear parents complain about strangers appearing at houses, or asking for personal information.
",7
"People also talk about games their child has been playing that's inappropriate.
",7
"It is not roblox's fault, they go through thousands of games a day, and keep in mind those games don't really appear on the front page and must be searched for.

"Yes there is some gross stuff there, its fine!

"i got bored, like in real life i did, and skipped school!
",1
"then my roblox parents were arrested for neglect and i got adopted.

"This game is so accurate, all the games about reel life(ex: highschool, adopt some kid) are boring, just like real life!
",8
"Tell your little ones to get away from this site this site has 200 bots trying to scam users everyday.
",8
"Also if you think that there's other games on the site that are kid friendly do not sign your child into this ambitious site.
",5
"I'm just letting every parent know that there's a lot of ""online daters"" or what they really are catfishes.
",7
"The community is VERY toxic, and is filled with perverts / child predators.
",3
"The administrators do nothing about bulling,  exploiting,  and other things.
",5
"The community in this game are pretty trash.

"It's a giant mixture of perverts, innocent kids, trash talkers (bullies), exploiters (hackers) and quite a large range of staff.

"If you report a player, nothing happens.

"Oh, not to mention the amount of Online Daters!

"game look great but another games that are bad for kids are bad
",2
"This website started out with high hopes, but peaked somewhere around 2016.
",2
"It has been downhill ever since and even with it's diverse platform to teaching kids how to program and getting them into 3D modeling, it is making it harder to justify spending time on it.
",8
"They slowly keep taking away key features that allow new game developers to get their awesome ideas seen by other players and it's turning the site into less of a fun creative outlet and more of just a selection of popular 3D games to select from and play.
",2
"So this ends up de-inspiring players to be creative and sends them into the actual games to play, which can be fine, but there is an alarmingly high amount of toxic people on roblox.
",2
"They just aren't nice to eachother.
",7
"The censor system has done a great job at stopping curse words, but that doesn't stop cruelty.
",1
"Just simply being around that many toxic players made it easier to come up with comebacks and the like.
",1
"With the removal of game genres, it's basically killed the little guys chance.

"I don't recommend just letting them play to play.

"Sometimes it can be as toxic as Call Of Duty.

"Now, the money of the card she spent on was a little, disturbing.

"Obviously you don't know fashion or words mom"".
",8
"And, you dissapoint me?
",3
"Kids, saying the n word?
",9
"Be very careful when your children are on this site.
",7
"The second most concerning thing is the bullying of kids if you don't enable in-app purchases of virtual goods.
",7
"Other kids tease them by calling them n00bs, which upsets the younger than 9 set.
",7
"The most concerning part is the sheer number of predators (called ODers or Online Daters) in every game.
",9
"They went up to my child and said some inappropriate things.
",0
"It's tough for small kids who don't know how to report these individuals.
",9
"This site is incredibly shady beyond belief.
",4
"Finally, there are multiple scams inside of games (which thankfully the system catches and shuts down quickly).
",8
"These scams look like popular games or are shell games that invite kids to go offsite and enter a lot of private information in order to win Robux (Roblox's in-game currency).
",7
"These are not the people I want or expect to be building a safe game play experience for my children or concerned about building a safe community.
",7
"They seem to be obsessed with building a social experience, being the next Facebook and meeting promises to their tech investors rather than putting the needs of children and their parents first.
",9
"And above all, please tell your kids not to exchange any information with strangers since Roblox will not put their safety above their ""engagement"" numbers.

"Roblox is a bad game.

"People cheat by finding loopholes past the chat filter by t y p i n g  l i k e  t h i s. If you insist on having your child play this game, then give then ""the talk"" and tell them what to do if they see porn or cussing.

"Animal Jam and Minecraft are better than this.

"I say 18+ because the fact that it has loads of online daters and even models that are banned.

"I don't say it has great messages because of the fact that roblox filter is garbage.

"70% of players manage to bypass the chat filter and end up swearing in the chat.

"I believe you should block this site and tell everyone about this.

"Whenever someone chats something that the filtering system finds inappropriate, it will turn the message into #'s kind of like using asterisks to block out swear words.

"Those games are the most popular among young kids and are in my opinion the games you shouldn't let your children play due to kids ""ODing"" (online dating) which is against Roblox's Terms of Service.

"It's an ADULT GAME!The ROBLOX Team allowed ODers to get in their game and do sexual activites!There are a lot of inappropriate games that has ODers and Child Predators in it,such as ""MeepCity"" ""Adopt and raise a baby"" , ""Boys and Girls Dance Club"" and much more.Buying Robux (in-game currency) is optional,but the amount of ODers and Pedophiles in ROBLOX is raising,so your kid may stole your credit/debit card then buy robux to make him/her looks ""cool"".Also,the report system is not working,so stop letting you

"P/S:ROBLOX is a playground for online daters,child predators and human  traffickers.My son reported a child predator and he got banned for 7 days.I don't know why.The two biggest child predator/ODer in ROBLOX are ""Euphoros"" and ""DJMykal"".

"Do not let your kids play this.

"Bought my 8 yo a robux gift card $25 and when he went to activate it didnt' work and ended up unintentionally purchasing a whole lot of roblox monthly builders club.
",0
"This is a money spinning machine for the creators they couldn't give a toss about protecting the kids using it.
",3
"Roblox was much less support especially given it had to do with the gift card to start with.
",6
"Other reviews indicate all sorts of problems with these gift cards.
",7
"I'm writing this to hope that many parents don't let their kids play this terrible game.
",4
"Let's list all the negative things with this game: Online Daters, a big part of the Roblox community,  especially on the game MeepCity online date, online dating is really bad for many reasons.
",2
"And many pedophiles pretend to be ODers (Online Daters) for get kids personal info and kidnap them.
",4
"And let's mention that Roblox seems to be protecting ODers and banning people that try to stop them, this is because of a reason, most of ODers buy robux to make their avatar look ""hot"" or ""cool"" and Roblox wouldn't like to ban them because they would lose alot of money.
",7
"Most of the ODers spend 10 dollars for their avatar, if Roblox gets money they don't care about the kids dating and getting kidnapped by pedophiles, next.
",6
"The community, it has been very obvious that the roblox community is really bad, if you would kill a person in a game expect alot to be called a noob or get bullied.
",3
"Many peoples judge you by your look, if your avatar hasn't been customized peoples will call you noob just by your look, which makes them bullies, next.
",5
"There will be always people that breaks the rules, let's see how Roblox handles this.
",9
"First off, the report feature doesen't work, if someone sees someone that is breaking the rules players report them.
",7
"Sigh- if everything worked... Roblox doesen't read reports, I made an account especially to break rules, I think I got 100+ reports on it but not even a ban or warning.
",6
"Let's now talk abou the chat filter, first off it censores words that are not even bad words,yes random words.
",7
"And many swear words get bypassed easly, I will not list them because I don't want random people to use them, and then the bypassed decals, many peoples made many inappropriate shirts and they got approved.
",1
"To end this, Roblox is a terrible game with a terrible community, many online daters and terrible moderation and chat filter.
",2
"Just don't bring kids to this game please.
",0
"I see a lot of it on ROBLOX , I decided to watch my kids play and it's out of control not good for kids that is 10 - 13.....
",7
"Sexual content is rare now they do actually ban inappropriate games daily fast, although for a while they went out of control and banned random games that weren't inappropriate and made a lot of people mad.
",1
"At one point there was a fairly serious issue with it but now it's not common.
",0
"Admins rarely ban people for cursing ingame though usually only if they curse on the forum or group wall.
",1
"In the past couple years they have gotten much worse on trying to take people's money.
",6
"Now you don't even get any virtual money without paying for it.
",6
"Overall it's a decent game and can be played without spending real money, but they are getting more and more greedy every year.
",6
"Just be sure to educate your child on things like this so they won't do anything stupid.
",7
"Do be warned this is very hardcore and many become heated or angry over it, but this is avoidable so i can still recommend if people are careful with there games.
",2
"There is so much bullying that happens on this game.
",2
"Even after disabling the chat my daughter still ends up in tears after playing.
",0
"Would not recommend.
",7
"First of all, ROBLOX does block swear words, but people find out ways to get around the censoring.
",1
"For example, a couple weeks ago, my friend Tyler found a way to say the F word in it, like ""F isis"" (Which I think is true, isis is bad.)
",3
"ROBLOX blocks swear words every day, but here's the real shocker; people have started making businesses to make more swear words on ROBLOX, along with scamming.
",1
"That's right, it's not one person working alone to make those scam bots.
",7
"People make ""Free ROBUX"" scams on ROBLOX with message bots, and bots that give you friend requests.
",5
"I have seen this many times, but ROBLOX blocks these games whenever it gets reported too many times.
",1
"I've seen a game called ""Club sanity"" that is just sick and disgusting.
",0
"Try to avoid those games, if possible.
",7
"If you ever see your child on a game that has them completely naked, pull them off of the computer ASAP.
",3
"These games are inappropriate, and if you can, ask your child to report the game, and tell them to stop playing it.
",7
"Why does my computer have a virus?""
",0
"It's not because of ROBLOX, it's because you or your child downloaded an extension or file that can't run ROBLOX correctly, and it's been trying to fix itself by scanning other files, and it's been trying to terminate the file that has been
",6
"keeping it from loading its own system preferences in.
",6
"Don't worry, the virus will only exist for a few weeks, and don't delete it, because if you delete it, ROBLOX has to start the whole process again.
",3
"If it shows up as a .WAV file, don't delete it, it's an audio file specially designed to terminate unknown launch files.
",2
"if it's any other type of file, DELETE IT, it is a virus.
",1
"This brings me to another problem most users have.
",9
"If your child has been friend-requesting random people and you see one asking your child's age, tell him/her to stop talking to the user, and report him/her if possible.
",7
"When I was younger, I had a problem with another user, named An0NyM00S3,
",0
"(I didn't understand what that meant, because I thought M00S3 meant Moose) and later that week, somebody showed up at my door, and I had to call the police.
",0
"Here's another problem, and probably my last problem of this list, consumerism.
",0
"ROBLOX is a good game, but it can be dangerous for kids of young age.
",2
"But many of the user generated games have less than desireable content.
",9
"He played games with murder, prison, cop killing, etc.
",8
"Worse yet he discovered there was no block on using the account I set up to buy more Robux.
",0
"$1,000 later it was a big mess.
",0
"He was in trouble for knowingly buying more Robux and lying about it (if briefly when confronted),  The platform taught him more bad things than good.
",9
"But the off color content, hacking, and deceitfulness engendered by Roblox has got it banned from our house - and that's not easy to do.
",2
"My 12yr old son has come across other players making 'inappropriate' comments and saw a user with a 'bad word' in their user name.
",8
"If your child is playing the game, there seems to be no filtering - they may be exposed to inappropriate comments.
",1
"Hello people I myself have reviewed Roblox and it's a horrible game I joined a game known by the name of ""Adopt and raise a cute kid"" and somebody said to me want to have ""six"" which already shows the chat filter is broken I seen people pretend dating and other players calling each other Mom/Mum and Dad turns out their old slogan used to be Roblox its free but everything costs money and mostly everyone swears.
",0
"I think it's not for children this is only my opinion.
",4
"On the surface it seems like a lot of fun, educational even but dig deeper and you will find that this game isn't much fun unless you are spending money.
",8
"Also, its a very violent game.
",3
"frist of all roblox community is bad VERY BAD there you can find spamers hakers and other... seocond if want play is game you need DONATE DONATE AND DONATE!
",7
"and spawnkillers i hate this only because thhe community but is game builded by the community soo if the community is bad  the bad too need more places yes is what makes the community if the community will be good ohh i the places you can make every thing and now your kid can join one wrost place.... soo you know creaiveof the wrost places makers isnt will stop  and there some hacks can make something you can see in youtube  aslo if the community will be good the game will be good soo the community will be 
",2
"Regardless of whether or not the game is good, there are a lot of articles out there stating that children have been exposed to inappropriate comments in the chat areas of this game.
",2
"I could not find hard evidence or reporting that substantiated these claims but I generally avoid games that allow my children to free chat anyway so the multiple anecdotal stories are enough to turn me away.
",8
"I think that the building is a great way for kids to use there imagination, but on the other hand people say really disturbing terms in the chat, I understand that its life and that I have preteens and I should let them do what they think is right at this age but I really think that what people are saying is not good, well for any age!
",4
"They already learned about the birds and the bees at school, but I will NOT let a silly game tell them about it because the information is inaccurate and rude.
",7
"Actually, regardless of age it censors out anything.
",1
"Any game that included those can and will be taken down by moderators.
",1
"Some games have violence, but the deaths are just blocks falling apart.
",3
"The only bad thing i'd consider is the consumerism; ROBUX.
",1
"And they make this game seem like it's an X rated site that is horrible.
",3
"Which is not true.
",3
"Which is not fully swearing because of the bad word blockers.
",1
"Also there is not much sexual content.
",2
"Bullying doesn't seem to be an issue.
",2
"This is the only part I disagree with on Roblox.
",2
"But they price them so high but don't give you a lot.
",6
"When I was playing it I got my account deleted for no reason at all!
",0
"I didn't even violate there rules and now my account will be forever gone.
",1
"I really hate roblox
",2
"Did any of you actually play the games with your children.
",7
"The Violence in many of the games is really not appropriate.
",3
"The Social connections are linking kids to ""Strangers- Pedophiles""  who are grooming them and talking very inappropriately to them.
",7
"Not a great message for a 7 year old,  I do not recommend this site.
",4
"i would tell you, to not to play the Titanic.
",7
"there are scary figures and too muck swearing.
",1
"please do not play that game!
",7
"TOO SEXUAL FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN!!
",0
"It is not appropriate for either.
",4
"It is like a school shooting waiting to happen.
",0
"It is worse than the news on a bad day.
",2
"It is horrifying that this is marketed to kids!
",9
"Some of the negative aspects are that many of the games involve killing one another with very real sounding guns, it does promote consumerism and since other player can create and share games, inappropriate games will sometimes appear.
",8
"Another game had players with very large penises.
",0
"My son reported it and that game was gone the next day.
",0
"I immediately reported it and ROBLOX removed it an hour later!
",0
"Also, reading some other reviews, It's come to my notice that some parents are angry that robux can only be bought.
",2
"Overall, you shouldn't be scared for your children of exposure to s3x and violence because there are bad people EVERYWHERE, and if your child knows how to be safe then you should be just fine.
",7
"Children usually know about s3x and violence by the age of third grade.
",9
"Dont give that website your password because with one  click of a button you could lose all your work on roblox.
",5
"I try to sign in the next day it says that the password is incorrect even though I choose the option to use the password for a certain profile and I have it copy and pasted on a notepad.
",5
"This game will take everything away in game with one simple click of a button.
",5
"There is no ""KYC"" (Know your customer"" procedure done by the Roblox corporation to make sure people are who they say they are.
",9
"Games are full of violence of course, swering and really CONSUMERISM.
",1
"It's very strange that no government is dong anything to ban this game.
",6
"Do not let your children play on it.
",7
"Now I have to worry about messages coming through the radio too!
",1
"I see that this has been reported since at least March and it has not been addressed.
",0
"This game is very disappointing.
",2
"UPDATED  I am done with this game.
",2
"Recently I overheard music playing in the background of my child's game that was sexually explicit.
",6
"We are done with Roblox.
",9
"If your child is under 16 DO NOT ALLOW HIM/HER to participate in this game.
",7
"However this is NOT the Roblox i grew to know and love.
",5
"3 days ago my 7 year old son said while crying that somebody kept following and bullying him.
",0
"And 2 days ago both of my kids wouldn't come off the computer when it was bedtime.
",0
"They started cussing and using words like ""Sh*t"" or ""F*ck"".
",1
"I seriously dont know what happened to Roblox.
",7
"It became a worse game with spoiled brats and bullies.
",3
"I banned it from the household yesterday.
",9
"~ Roblox is NOT a sexual game.
",1
"It is simply just bad players of the community posting online.
",2
"Filtering Disabled games usually have exploiters swimming in it.
",8
"Overall:
",0
"Roblox is a GREAT game, but there are some really crappy games.
",8
"So let your kids play, just if you see porn, it's not my fault.
",7
"Tho it does have crude and violent content , such as the game
",9
"(Prison Life 2.0v) There are guns like AK-47 and Remington's.
",3
"However before you think I am a careless parent.
",3
"Look who am I to tell you what's good for your kids.
",7
"But I think you should read what the game is about before downloading the freaking game.
",7
"So , you really might be the reckless and careless parent!
",3
"Also I saw a review from another ""parent"" that said his friends avatar was used as an ad.
",0
"TAGS
",0
"Ok , first off players can absolutely NOT get addresses or emails.
",1
"Also along with curses or sex.
",5
"Some games will have blood, and some games in the horror genre will contain jumpscares and disturbing images.
",1
"I would not recommend to buy this game or its components or images They appear to be sort-lived and our personal impression is that game is managed fro offshore with high probability of at best questionable intents of its founders.
",7
"From the day that my son said that his account will be hacked.
",0
"There are some games for kid like 6+, but online dating and interaction or intercourse is common because I watched roblox and they bad descions.
",5
"The report system doesn't work so that makes it just a tad unsafe.
",7
"Honestly there is some trash on this game, but overall I believe it to be kid friendly.
",2
"Accounts of adware and predation only come from isolated cases were users shared information that was not ok to share such as contact details or mailing addresses, and as for inopropriate games, educate your kids!
",9
"Don't let the trash on the internet ruin you for a good game!
",2
"Also I saw some comments and reviews earlier saying that roblox wasn't free and used inopropriate sites in their advertising, honestly before though make accusations you should make sure that adware came from roblox and not from other places.
",9
"Once again don't let a couple of bad apples ruin the barrel, just distance yourself from them.
",1
"Also games that parents would have a problem with aren't the most popular and usually have to be sought out.
",5
"ROBLOX Is a online game, which means there will always be bad people.
",1
"It depends on what games you play to avoid these bad people, don't play games that is family related, because those are the games most people come to and troll there and do bad things to children.
",3
"The parental controls may be a joke, but if you tell your kids to avoid these games they most likely will.
",7
"The games are totally offensive!
",8
"I walked in on my child playing a game where you murder people to win, also once the game he was playing a game where you work at a pizza shop and it got hacked and bad words such as ""f*ck"" was written all over the screen.
",0
"This isn't what got my child to stop playing the game.
",0
"The reason is because a pedophile asked my child's address and pretended to be his brother.

"This site is just absolutley disgusting.

"Do not play.

"It is very inappropriate because it has lots of inappropriate messages in the game

"I am sorry, but they are just making it uncomfortable.

"( sorry for my bad inglish I am Russian)
",3
"It has mostly kids stuff but some mature content.fantasy violence, online dating sometimes,but if you swear in the chat it turns into hashtags like if you type the f word in it looks like this ####.

"But sadly in the last few years it has turn down hill.

"But less like it then I used to.
",6
"A lot of people seem date roleplay or swear.

"Name calling seems to be everyware.
",9
"But They seem to let rude stuff go pass and stuff that ok not pass.
",2
"This site has very bad mods and I seen admins be rude to players.

"And Roblox you need spend a lot of cash just not to be bullyed on there.

"Their are meny games that have no one playing on.

"They have access to a variety of games, videos and other media platforms that also are poorly monitored and moderated.

"Users are frequently using inappropriate language and content on this site and it should NOT be rated for kids as young as 10.

"First off if theres any innoproprite things you must have searched that up in games its hidden so many people dont find it unless they type it up online daters its in all kids game animal jam,msp,roblox many more games you cant stop people and as far as bullying its a friken website theres going to be bullying.

"Not only that but I had this game on my 2 computers, and both of them got viruses from it.

"I do not recommend this game for anyone under 15 unless they have good discernment.

"And about the Viruses, I haven't seen anyone else complain about that so I don't know.

"5) Moderation by Roblox is iffy at best - do your own moderation.

"I also use Qustodio to automatically block the app if I find they aren't following the rules and also to limit their pay to certain times and days of the week.

"In my personal experience of playing roblox for about 6 or so years, I definitely do not recommend this game to anyone.

"This game Is a huge cash mule.
",1
"The game or its creators don't care about how much money, what you do , how dedicated you are, they will ban you and be proud of it , over the smallest thing.
",2
"They are a bunch of Democrats.
",9
"They do not give refunds and if you charge back they will deleted your account (personal experience) the game itself is fun , besides all of the un-protected non safe players constantly swearing (avoids swear detection system by typing something like f*ck) or trying to date or gather personal information.

"My main complaint is that this game is a cash mule and all they care about is your money.
",4
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH IT, AND PLEASE SPREAD .
",0
"they deserve nothing more than to rot in a ditch.

"For those who say that there were porn pics and other things like swearing, it was because in 2012 there was a massive cyberattack on ROBLOX, in which many of its security problems were disabled.
",5
"The only thing they could fix/greatly inprove is on games that you can trade theirs is a LOT of scammers I have been scammed before and they are  frequently encountered in game
",5
"This game can be abused, as it is an 8 to 18 aimed website, but if you ever find anything with sexuality, or anything of that sort, you have to remember, this is the internet, anyone can say or do anything.
",7
"As a teen who used to play this game and now has a sister who does, i'm absolutely disgusted.
",0
"Users create their own games and levels, which, on one hand is a good thing, but on the other, fifty percent of user - created games include pretty much every kind of thing you don't want your child viewing on purpose or not.
",2
"Though the community does consist of many kids, and honestly some can be really harsh (even to developers).
",3
"They are usually also filterenabled meaning that player's can't hack to do anything inappropriate, and what you see is only in the game.
",2
"I am so angry at the filters not working at this game.
",0
"It's ridiculous !
",8
"Advise to any parent not to let their children play this game
",7
"There are no parental controls in this game.
",1
"The chats within the games are live and not documented so there is no way for parents to monitor those conversations.
",2
"..It's a shame because the game itself has so much potential to be a great learning tool that is fun and creative.
",4
"I can't allow my kids to play because there is now way that I can keep up with the chat and things that come up such as online dating and sex in the games.
",1
"My 12 year old played this game at a friends house and saw sexual content.
",0
"I would recommend that you do not let your child play this game.
",7
"I am very frustrated that it appears to be child appropriate, but it's not!
",1
"I would not recommend any 9 or younger aged playing this game without supervision.
",4
"For violent games, it's not much than cartoon figure robot or animals killing each other.
",3
"I would recommend any 12 or younger to have chat not available to them.
",4
"Anyone who dares to have sex on this game would be banned immediately.
",0
"I wouldn't allow any 13 or younger to chat because of swearing.
",4
"It is just mainly like smoking a cartoon cigarette that doesn't even look like a cigarette drinking just sounds like the way a normal person drinks most of the time and drugs aren't really a big deal either although it may not be suitable for younger generation.
",1
"There are hackers and people who ask for personal information so I would watch any 12 or younger who has chat available to them.
",4
"From d--m to f--k, there is also plenty of sexual things said in the chat.

"CONS: Terrible  moderation

"Anyone who has heard those stories should not take it lightly with your young kids playing this game!
",2
"I was completely upset and made her delete it from her tablet.

"Horrible structure to the game.
",6
"Having been a veteran of this game for up to 6 years, the moderation services used for keeping the community safe and appropriate for all ages has severely declined and are not as efficient as they used to be.
",6
"Reports will often go unanswered, enabling users who curse and act inappropriately to continue said behavior.
",7
"Additionally, the act of false reporting en masse has been known to result in innocent users being moderated or even having their accounts terminated for no reason.
",5
"While it theoretically makes it easier for them to handle reports, this filter can be ""broken"" by repeatedly sending the same report over and over until a user has been wrongfully moderated.
",5
"This fault continues to be abused on a daily basis.
",9
"Additionally, any amount of cursing or inappropriate content will not be detected by filters simply by creating spaces in sentences or using special characters such as ""&"" or ""#"" to disguise it.
",1
"Side note: a considerable bulk of games are also oriented around violence and shooting.
",2
"Users who play these games tend to be more hostile/aggressive, leading to swearing and mean spirited behavior - which potentially exposes younger aged children to words that any parent would not want their child to ever use.
",5
"-On roblox there are 'somewhat' violent games but in no way enough to damage a childs future.
",2
"Yes , some of the prices are outrageous , but when you have to host a website and a game with million and millions of users online at the same time, you need money to hold them open.
",8
"Its weird and ugly looking, broken in every way, graphics, gameplay, and more!
",0
"Not worth anything!
",6
"It didn't work so she reordered it only to find out that it was ordered twice.
",1
"We contacted Xbox who couldn't help and referred us to Roblox who basically threatened to close my child's account.
",0
"Since they couldn't locate the correct account, and said that their policy says they are not able to refund us, they went ahead and removed all the robux from my sons Roblox account.
",7
"In other words, they stole the money we paid them since they removed all the robux without issuing a refund to my account!
",0
"Bottom line is that if they  cannot refund me, then they have no legal right to remove what is rightfully ours.
",7
"This is ridiculous!
",2
"There are advertisements everywhere and like others have mentioned there is a lot of inappropriate activity due to terrible moderation throughout the game.
",3
"I would like to sue the company for stealing my money.
",7
"It's an economy system for Roblox It's not free.
",6
"If someone is being unhappy toward you.
",0
"The problem is that Roblox is sometimes expensive and sexual content can be there and Online Dating is part of the strict rules.
",1
"This game has extreme privacy concerns.
",3
"Games can be pretty violent (they can be made by anyone), and there is Online Daters (Oders, if you will.)
",3
"That doesn't mean  the game is bad.
",2
"But after a few updates to the site I noticed that ROBLOX is barely free to play anymore.
",9
"They took away the free currency, so now you have to PAY to get money ('Robux') just to customize your character.
",5
"People sometimes curse in profane ways (Chat can be turned off, but the comments of games can't.)
",1
"People discriminate a lot, if you just joined you are a 'noob'.
",3
"If your character doesn't have and cool shirts or hats, people will ignore you on team games.
",7
"Just limit them to what they do on the site,  and don't let them respond back, as there is some cyber bullying on the site.
",7
"Now I don't know what other parents are thinking, saying, and I quote ""Roblox is not for kids"".
",3
"Now let's be honest, they're are a few violent games, but your character always dies with the same screen: A flash of red and then he explodes into BLOCKS, THAT'S RIGHT, BLOCKS.
",2
"I guess if you find a game you don't want them playing just tell them, the only other problem is the consumerism, but let's be honest, they can just get a Roblox or iTunes or whatever store gift card and buy some robux with THEIR OWN money, again, it's not a big deal.
",7
"DON'T LISTEN TO PARENTS SAYING IT'S ""Horrible"" and ""Not for kids'.
",0
"When I read some of the reviews, it seemed to be split down either ""very fun"" or ""not safe for kids"" and you know what?
",1
"Say what you want about roblox, the community is by far the worst part.
",9
"Full of swearing little kids and online daters.
",8
"If you're easily butthurt, or a parent with a still innocent little kid, I wouldn't recommend letting them play

"This game has severe privacy concerns.

"My daughter was completely scammed and lied to at the ""friendly"" community.

"We have purchased her the membership and money add-ons and due to a roblox security fail someone got into her account and deleted everything.

"I wouldn't recommend letting your child on this site.

"Just, no.

"This game's violent, as well as online dating, crudeness, etc.

"This game CANNOT be introduced to children under the age of 12/13, because they will get obsessed, just like me.

"Don't waste your time on this, and don't risk your child's innocence with this game.

"Also, moderation sucks.

"While most are good for a child to play, others are violent, frightening, or vulgar.

"Please monitor your kids while playing this game.
",7
"I for one will not be allowing my children to play on this website anymore.

"First of all, if you're thinking since it downloads software it downloads malware, you're wrong.
",2
"However, the site also has some flaws.
",1
"It's very easy for younger children to end up on phishing sites from bot-accounts made by the owners of those sites.
",5
"There are also lots of spam that trick you thinking that you will receive ROBUX.

"Dear players of current and future roblox it has come to my concern that roblox will no longer have the option to purchase  a lifetime membership for any of the builders clubs.
",5
"It just doesn't seem fair to take away that option for the new players of roblox while the old ones get to earn money on the account till they die.
",4
"people can say words like ""crap"" ""piss"" and ""bastard"" if their accounts are not set at the correct age.
",1
"I also think ROBLOX's consumerism is too much as most of the websites good features can only be accesed by Builders club membership and/or buying ROBUX.
",8
"The community is terrible!
",2
"Yes there is alot of swearing!
",2
"not all the games are terrible...  And if u say you are under 13 u will get sended with ######## ######## ###### EVERYTIME SOMEONE SAYS SOMETHING NOT IN THE DICTIONARY!
",8
"IT MAKES ME WONDER IF IT WAS A BAD WORD OR SOMETHING!
",0
"Some members can swear, and spam.
",5
"well in games at least as for the learning tool... well that is a but complicated at first and it can take years to get used too!
",2
"A lot of people think this for ROBLOX: it's a trashy website full of trolls and Online Daters.
",2
"Here's the truth: it's NOT.
",1
"Then came 2013, that's when it began to start getting spammers and ODers.
",0
"(There were always ODers, but not as many as today) and I began to slowly watch as it began to fill up with mean and crude players.
",1
"People will ALWAYS critizise your avatar (3.0 packages replaced the default ones, and ODers began to use them.
",6
"also, yes, there's violence, and the moderation system doesn't always work, but ROBLOX is actually really strict about the games allowed.
",1
"I don't really like playing the murder games, (there's no major violence.
",8
"the community has gotten pretty bad though, but you can just enter a command (/ignore [playername]) to stop seeing the players chat, and report him/her.
",5
"If it still bothers you, I suggest leaving the game and trying a different one, something that's not on the front page.
",9
"Don't Online Date, (if you do, be advised you could be IP banned, (the ban where you can no longer enter the website) and also generate a TON of hate).
",5
"Roblox isn't what most think, but it still can be if not taken care of properly.
",2
"If you see somebody not following the rules of ROBLOX, Report them immediately, and leave the game (this is just MY opinion.)

"the currency can also suck you up in a trap.

"Buying Robux isn't the smartest decision.
",2
"There's also Builders Club, but I wouldn't buy any of them, besides the cheapest one.

"has blood,violence,gore,and other suggestiv themes.
",2
"Recently ive noticed people cussing a LOT on games, such as Apocalypse Rising, a game ive loved since 2013, this game is aimed at 13+ players.
",1
"I have seen moderate filtering of things people say using the chat system(only available to a player above 13 years old) but this doesn't always work, for instance, misspelling a cussword usually gets through the filtering, which is a problem the roblox corporation is trying to fix,  HOWEVER, there have been 6 games ive seen with sexual content, since the start of roblox, i guarantee you, these games are added to the site around midnight, and are deleted about 30 minutes later, there creators suspended for 
",1
"this means it will not allow the user to creat a new account at all.
",5
"Also 1/3 games on roblox have to do with mild violence, which means it will have blood occasionally, but would resemble a game like call of duty, without blood, and overly violent deaths( In call of duty games , people scream violentlly as they die, this isnt on roblox AT ALL.)
",8
"USERS ARE CONSTANTLY SWEARING AND BULLYING,TOLD THIS TO ROBLOX WHO IGNORE IT.
",0
"Yes, some minor swearing and many games have guns and such.
",1
"But if you dont want your child seeing that, dont let them play that specific game.
",7
"Sometimes people can make highly inappropriate games and hack the filter, as I've seen some parents posting about.
",1
"I don't know why it seems rated rather low for learning, when kids can learn how to code and make games on it, not to mention how to manage and earn money.
",4
"The is little monitoring  of inappropriate interaction.
",2
"My child's account was hacked and I tried to email them but the email failed .
",0
"Once my child's account was hacked I did not want her on there.

"I would not recommend this website to younger children.

"Roblox is a seemingly harmless game, however, some things are just plain disappointing about it.

"""Roblox"" is a building game that allows you to build your very own house, or zombies, or giant monsters that terrorize you for no reason.
",4
"Some games, however are violent, and there are even RECREATIONS of games like GRAND THEFT AUTO.
",3
"So that's violence.
",0
"Just make sure you tell your child that these people are just silly.
",7
"There is also Turbo and Outrageous, which are more expensive.
",8
"My biggest concern is the safety of children on here.
",5
"These two other children were BULLYING him and ""freezing"" and ""punishing"" him for ABUSING the admin (which is no reason to do that).
",0
"Violence is frequently seen in games, considering that this is the type of audience that the game caters to.
",3
"Privacy is only an issue if kids are not taught to be safe.
",2
"In many instances, people have complained that their kids are not safe because users try to get personal information from people.
",9
"Although this does not often happened, and is exaggerated by parents, the fact may be their fault because they are leaving their kids uneducated; this is probably the main reason that privacy is an issue.
",9
"Another complaint that many parents had was the online dating factor.
",4
"The site does NOT support online dating, and will take moderation actions on kids that pretend to have ""girlfriends"" or ""boyfriends.""
",4
"Disguising of language to try to bypass filters is looked for by moderators, and is most always found and punished.
",1
"The final issue is consumerism.
",6
"This is probably the most major issue on Roblox.
",9
"I know what your thinking... WHY 7!!!!!
",7
"There is some killing.. And in some games its like blood...
",3
"But the blood is transparent red sqaures.. And deaths are just your person falling apart... Its like sliding de-attatched legos across a floor...

"This site has some violence, but not a lot.

"But there are some very suggestive things that you don't want your kid to see.

"People love to bypass the system and say some very terrible things, and add some suggestive.

"Also there are tons of child predators and E-Daters here on Roblox.

"Roblox really needs to fix moderation.

"You get banned for no reason alot.

"ok so Roblox as a game always claims something about their right and policy but one day, I was playing project slayers and a guy asked me to join his party I said no but the dude said I was stupid then I got angry and overreacted.

"### Chat moderation can be bypassed if clever enough, but it is not easy to do so, and the bypassing player will almost always get in trouble with manual moderation afterwards.

"### Predators and otherwise dangerous people and content will always be present on any social platform of sufficient size.

"And keep in mind: Dangerous things are found in dangerous places.

"It's good for 10 year olds and under but it's every easy to commit a cyber crime.

"Plus there are also very DIRTY people as my mum would say who would show your kids s*xy stuff and really inappropriate stuff no kid should be forced to see.

"It's dangerous!!

"The problem with it is that there is just no moderation what-so-ever.

"If you report something, nothing is going to happen.
",7
"Then I saw something  disgusting about Roblox.
",0
"You buy Robux with Real life money, in exchange for this fake in-game money.
",6
"Basically, in order to make pretty much ANY progress at all in this game, you need Robux.
",7
"And the worst part is, they're most likely the most expensive in-game currency to buy.

"And if you even try to report them, Roblox does not do anything.
",7
"I don't like Roblox, by any means, If I had a child I probably would not allow them to play Roblox, but, atleast it's kind of fun.
",7
"Also, most people do not follow Roblox's terms of service.
",8
"Roblox has strict guidelines, and nobody follows them.
",3
"And Roblox doesn't do anything about it.
",7
"But I'm not a parent.
",7
"The only problem is that since it is online, a lot of the people completely disregard the rules.
",1
"For example, there are countless documents of hate directed towards ethnic groups like LGBTQ, BLM, etc.
",1
"in the avatar store, all the items are overpriced, and all the shirts and pants relating to lgbtq have three quarters of the comments spewing total bullcrap about LGBTQ and other groups.
",2
"not to mention the toxic kids and exploiters.
",4
"Roblox is a great game for children and adults alike but I would not let your kids go free on this app since it has multiple problems.
",2
"There are a lot of adults that want to do bad stuff with children and I know a lot about it since I got groomed when I played Roblox at 12 years old, BUT if you just supervise your kids this problem will not occur.

",4
"Its so boring, all the games on it are so stupid, you don’t even have to use your brain for this game, its just 8 year olds role playing, or like parkour games.

"This is not where I am getting at.
",3
"If your kid is however, breaking these rules, well, just like if they are doing ANYTHING they aren't supposed to on the internet, you should teach them that it is wrong and monitor them on the internet, or in this specific case, Roblox, the Roblox website, and Roblox games.

"Getting bullied isn’t common, and even if someone decided to be mean, just be the better person and leave.

"Unfortunately, it's become difficult to avoid these games on the platform, but if you want your child to play the game and they're under the age of 13, I recommend turning off their chat in the parental settings (so they don't see inappropriate messages and they're not risking their safety on the platform), look at who your child is talking to on there and look at their convos with other people, and perhaps limit their screentime on there.
",7
"Something else that isn't good at all is that children tend to waste a lot of money on the game too, such as items called 'limiteds' which can be worth over 10k dollars in real life with some of the items.

"People on there tend to buy those to show off to other people, but parents need to be wary as well that children tend to take their parents' credits card and spend it on those types of things, which you usually aren't refunded.
",8
"As previously stated, avoid such games if your child does not want to interact with such people.
",7
"However, the moderation system is abysmal.

"Too much online stuff I'm pretty sure people under 13 can't play it because Minecraft is Just safer for all the kids so if your kids are looking for a game to play just download them Minecraft it's only $7 but if they download  Roblox there going to ask you for $20 Roblox and if they ask you that but when they want mine coins on Minecraft they can get it for $15 so you'd say you have to pay a little bit more for your child's safety

"I hope Roblox sees this and fixes their ways, but based on how they already are, they might just ban me even longer for writing things like this.
",6
"So what we have is good games, bullies getting to ban you for no reason, bullies getting away with bullying a young soul navigating the game (which I will NOT let them get away with), and saying very bad things and having you get banned and they get away with it, which lets them think they get to do whatever with no consequences, which can lead to very bad things.
",9
"EDIT 2: More things I should mention, some Roblox games are very questionable, we've heard about this kind of thing on the news, Im surprised Roblox bullies weren't there alongside it, anyways these kinds of games any kid can find, and when they see it, being the curious people they are, will play it and see things.
",9
"Things Roblox must fix: bullying, glitching, and bad games.
",2
"Not bad like they're not good the, inappropriate type.
",1
"Roblox should do something like if a new game is being made they should review it, and see if the age rating is good or not, and actually check who's bullying instead of just banning some random person, and fix the glitches.
",7
"Glitches like freezing the screen and when you try to look around it only zooms in and out of your character, and Roblox kicking you out.

"I've also seen videos on wrongful bans on YouTube, like saying lol in a game and then getting banned for a day because of it (but who knows the context of it).

"EDIT 3: I was just wrongfully banned for standing up for myself to a bully who sent me death threats, wow Roblox.

"All I know is that this game gets worse and worse.

"Some of the bullies I met on Roblox (KJT for example she was also a very bad bully who needs to be banned, cmon Roblox) were actually funny and threaten to do something they can't do, but they'd do it (banning someone cuz u didn't want to meet their friend right now) so Roblox needs to make ultimate changes.
",6
"So really at this point all you have to do in Roblox to not get banned is to just crawl up in a ball and hide in a game by yourself (which I do not recommend).
",5
"EDIT 5: me and my friend were playing Roblox catalog avatar and some Karl kid was copying out characters way too much, so I reported Karl and told Roblox to actually do something and later he was still there and my friend was not listening to me after I decided he should report Karl and move on.
",0
"And it seems that that's a reason why I was banned again.
",0
"Roblox is not putting words into my mouth, and I've never seen that before.
",1
"Either it's that or the Karl kid put the words into my mouth, but I've been banned 3 times.
",1
"All of them were wrongful ones, Roblox is just getting out of hand now.
",2
"EDIT 6: Another thing to mention, everytime there's a bully it's either they get away with it or I get banned.
",4
"And soon their banning alt accounts if your main one is banned, too.

"If you catch your kid playing an inappropriate game, most likely they had to search it up.

"Other parents complain about the game ""Adopt Me"" because of the name.

"Other than that, I do feel like roblox should tag the word  ""Dam"" and ""Hell"" .
",1
"Though ""Dam"" is not a curse word, kids have been using it to curse instead of ""D--m"" .
",1
"They also use ""Hell"" very commonly as "" wth"" or "" what the hell ?

"- To find bad games/innappropriate games on roblox you have to SEARCH for them, meaning that if you see your child playing one, he/she went an actively SEARCHED for it and played it full knowing it was a bad/innappropriate game to do those innappropriate/bad actions (Yeah, may wanna ground your child or turn on some safety features and parental control options).
",7
"It started to get a lot more weirder and lots of kissing and dating and Roblox still said's that MeepCity is for All Ages, I don't think so... Also, There are games there that has Realist Blood/Gore that Roblox doesn't really deal with a lot and games where they allow you swear without tags.
",8
"Also, Here are some buggy-laggy parts of Roblox.
",2
"So, Whenever you get hacked and you send an email out to Roblox, They don't do anything, All they do is ask ""Stuff to do when you get hacked"" And when my Roblox account got hacked and I sent an Email, It did NOTHING.

"It just let that hacker sell my items and act like they own the account.
",6
"Another laggy part of Roblox is that the Bans are not even good, The Moderators just see someone say a word like ""Noob"" or something and they just ban them right away, Can't Roblox hire good and pleasant Mods that actually bans someone for a reason instead of letting Online-Daters just kiss Online?

"Excessive gore is prohibited, and games that include it are taken down often.
",3
"Games that Roblox see as glorifying violence and other related topics such as recreating tragic world events such as the Holocaust and 9/11 are prohibited.

"Too much sex
",8
"Roblox encountered widespread media coverage around 2018 of the emergence of sexually explicit games on the platform, but the corporation has since taken extreme actions against them.
",9
"The genre of games, known in the communities as “condos,” are an effectively extinct species.

"If a player is not looking for them, there is an extremely, extremely low chance they will ever find them.
",6
"Even if they do search for it, they will not show up in results.
",7
"Rumors have sent the perpetrators of these inappropriate games running, as rumors have it Roblox has began to threaten legal action against those continuously breaking Roblox’s rules on explicit content.
",6
"Too much swearing
",1
"Roblox has an extremely strict chat filter that replaces words or phrases seen as problematic with a random number of “######.” Some examples of what the filter looks for includes profanity, addresses, phone numbers, and occasionally certain names.
",8
"Some players will attempt to bypass this filter by using foreign characters and intentional misspellings, but they can be reported to moderators where they face bans and terminations.
",1
"Too much consumerism
",8
"Roblox’s only official currency is Robux, which serves a widespread purpose.
",9
"Robux is quite pricy, as the cheapest purchasing option is eighty Robux for one US dollar, and the next being four-hundred Robux for five US dollars.

"A WARNING TO PARENTS
",0
"By far Roblox’s biggest problem is exploitation of children by scammers and creeps.
",9
"Number one, and the worst, grooming.
",1
"There have been rare, but documented claims of attempted grooming by adults towards impressionable children.
",2
"The actual grooming never happens on Roblox only begins.
",2
"The predator will meet the victim on Roblox, maybe friend them, talk to them in the private chat, but no harm will be done with Roblox’s inability to send images and the strong chat filter.
",9
"How the predator exploits the child is by leading them away from Roblox and onto a separate service, most often Discord.
",8
"Discord is a fantastic app that is great for talking with people and forming a community, but it is supposed to be for those thirteen and older, and has no filter or safety protections.
",1
"Another problem with Roblox is scams.
",1
"Sadly, the lowest scum on Earth will try to trick your kids.
",9
"There are the flat-out scams, and the sketchy sites.
",8
"The first is the dying breed.
",9
"Spoiler alert, it doesn’t work any you might have just gotten a computer virus, The second is the sketchy sites, which actually do give you Robux when you complete surveys.
",5
"However, these survey websites are probably doing illegal activities and are collecting personal data on your child.
",4
"Also, the Robux was probably not obtained legitimately.
",0
"And of course, this is all highly against Roblox’s rules.
",4
"The second method of scams is in-game, where scammers will use the advertise game feature to promote a fake game posing as the official Roblox account.
",8
"They will have a fraudulent but real-looking game that asks your child to put in their username and password to get free Robux, but obviously all you get is an account stolen.
",5
"(Conclusion)
",0
"Roblox is not a perfect platform, especially one with so many users.
",2
"lots of creeps and perverts though.

"reporting kind of stinks though.

"There are also h***y kids who will harass you.

"There are so many games to play, and you can block your child from playing certain games is they include sensitive stuff.

"I would like to warn you that people do find a way to say swears in the chat using letters (qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm), numbers (1234567890), and these things that I can't remember the name of right now (~!

"my only concern is people are jerks on here, i can handle it since i'm 15 but younger kids might not be able to.

"It’s sort of fun but makes you rage a lot and people will judge you and there are all sorts of guns and knives and you can fight and people will literally kill you if you don’t match a certain style or if you look as if you are “poor” or a noob.
",3
"Ever since the voice chat feature was unexpectedly added, it’s gotten a lot worse.
",1
"Also, roblox will literally do nothing about hacked accounts.
",6
"I’ve seen several videos and posts even on this website about how people’s account get hacked on roblox by scammers, hackers, and even anyone and will email roblox with tons of proof that they own the account and roblox will literally still not help them.
",5
"the report option in roblox is merely useless, in my almost 5 years of playing roblox, i sure know well that if you report a player, it will not work at all.
",7
"( based on my thousands of arguments and bad things i have came across ) i’ve reported many people before, but at this point everyone knows roblox’s monitoring system is dog crap and the only thing they end up banning is if a inappropriate game is created, such as games called “condos”.
",1
"the games literally allow you to have private parts attached to your body and the chat is hacked by the creator and ANYTHING you say will go through the filter, there are almost inappropriate animations made into the games that allow players to have sexual intercourse and it is much more easier on these games obviously for kids to give out private information to random old men that are on them since the chat filter is not filtered at all.
",1
"I discovered a ton of condo games when i was around 8-9 and always have been traumatized after seeing pixalized sex.
",6
"But now these days, it is a lot harder to find condo games as if you would have to join online social media groups on apps like discord for example to access condo games because roblox will filter the word out if you search things like “condo” or “con” on the game search bar.
",5
"The closest thing to gore they often allow is either a 2D texture of blood or an almost flat red cylinder.
",6
"A lot of the negative reviews about the violence on here is “I saw my 12 year old shoot a zombie with a gun!
",0
"I banned it from my child for life!” It’s basically the same as a Nerf gun or water balloons in real life.

"If you see someone who is rude, just ignore them.

"Some parents complain about people bypassing the chat filter with @ or $.

"There’s more cussing on a school bus.
",0
"If you or your child ever goes out to public places like school or the grocery store, you will hear cussing.
",6
"It’s not nice but it’ll happen no matter how sheltered a child is.
",7
"Some games can also be scary, for example, doors or the mimic.
",4
"Well it was ok I don’t really like it it’s kinda boring game and there are some scary games that could scare your little one but what I recommend when every kid turns 10 they hav to watch inception
",7
"Also watch out for some people on there they can be a rude and it honestly depends on the world you go in.

"There are some inappropriate games that kids should not join and kids should not trust random people.

"I do not recommend this game to your child.

"I had to take away his Computer away, and only let him play on the weekend.

",2
"If anything happens to compromise the safety of your account and/or valuable items you own then the chances are it's beyond anything Roblox Support could do to help.
",4
"They seriously need to revamp their whole contacting, support and emailing  system.
",6
"Losing items that took months of saving up for is really disheartening and to be told by the support team that no, my account did not get compromised and I ""willing"" made a trade where I lost 96% of my limiteds value to an account made 46 days ago is a slap on the face.
",6
"But aside from support team issues, the website is constantly breaking or facing connection issues in games and the difficulty of having an everyday conversation is absurd.
",3
"Those on top of exploiters running rampant and worsening catalogue updates really bring down the standard of the website down
",9
"Sure, that may sound great and all, however, it is not so great as it seems on paper.
",2
"Some online games may be kid friendly, but the players most certainly will not always be so.
",2
"Roblox's poor moderation leads to rather questionable avatars which may be too revealing or downright lewd , as well as inappropriate comments from other users.
",1
"Although rare, there are most certainly people who dress/ role-play as very offensive groups, such as those who role-play as the Nazis.
",1
"Depending on the game, various forms of violence may be a common sight which may include gun violence.
",8
"Roblox tries constantly to get users to buy 'Premium' as well as Robux, as well as even other users pressuring users to buy robux.
",1
"Although it can be fun, it may also be very problematic.
",1
"One last note: Some time in 2018, a seven year old girl's Roblox avatar was 'gang raped' by exploiters.
",0
"If that is concerning, Roblox may not be a good choice.
",3
"Now let me tell you about the bad things.
",7
"Some games have violence, sex, and swearing.
",3
"Game violence is not that bad.
",3
"Although, the sex is bad.
",1
"The problem is that even in the good games have some sexual people playing them.
",1
"Now about the swearing.
",9
"Though Roblox is trying to make the chat appropriate, some people find ways to swear.
",1
"One time, someone said F (username) to me just because I beat him in a game.
",0
"it's so unbelievably trash please don't even try getting into it first off, literally all the devs do is sit and watch as their community carry their platform through good games and ugc items meanwhile all that hardwork gets funded worse than a 9 year old with an allowance.
",6
"second of all, I played a game in which you could build structures and all and then at some point in the middle of the map spawns a giant tower with a bunch of images of real life decapitated bodies and por4grophy and even dead children.
",9
"PLEASE do not let your kids play this horribly maintained and unsafe game.
",4
"Its a good game i like it even though there are a bunch of annoying scammers in a lot of games that try to give you ""free robux"" but really just steal your account when you put in the information for it.
",8
"If any other kids read this DON'T FALL FOR THEIR SCAMS THEY WILL NOT GIVE YOU ROBUX THEY WILL STEAL YOUR ACCOUNT DON'T FALL FOR IT also scammers suck and they should stop trying to convince the kids on roblox to go to their website to get robux.
",7
"There are also a bunch of online daters who also suck because a kid could be thinking that they are online dating a girl/guy who are the same age as them, but really are like 50 years old.
",2
"That's just so unintelligent man.
",2
"Getting back to the subject of scammers, they suck and should get banned from existence.
",9
"In fact, scamming people for robux should be a crime that is punishable by 10000 years jail time with the worst of the worst of people in the jail, or at least have them pay 1000000000000000000 dollars.
",8
"i dislike tht they ban u when u cuss a child or some bc its not ur fault like listen to wht happen to me hey ban me right for 7 days when some random child came up to me n started on my case saying mean stuff so i could do nun but say some bk so then tht child report me bc how i was treating her like come on i dont got time to ban children u start ur stuff ima finish it by saying some bk dont go running n reporting me when u know u sarted ur drama
",6
"emos are disgusting make sure your child doesnt become one otherwise they would want to commit suicide.
",7
"the game is very fun but they make it worse every day adding bad updates and now it feels like they care more about money then anything else but good game i made many friends with it
",6
"This is one OBVIOUS red flag.
",2
"Kids go there about to steal someone's credit card.

"Like some person got banned for saying ""pog.""
",0
"I don't know how that's a reason to get banned.
",6
"HECK SOMEONE EVEN GET BANNED FOR SAYING HI!
",0
"HOW IS THAT A GOOD REASON TO GET BANNED?!
",0
"And, there are child predators and people that are toxic.
",3
"People can also get hacked easily, but roblox moderation and support will refuse to investigate.
",4
"So the games are good, but not the whole entire platform is good.
",2
"Although, you have to watch the servers your kids are in, people can be very sexual and mean.
",7
"Overall this was my entire childhood and if your kid hasn’t played roblox, shame on you bro.
",0
"The internet has too many people in it to control, and the internet is horny all the time!
",2
"if you think you're child is too young for the internet he/she is too young for Roblox.

"can not change add would not recommend for game creators
",5
"While Roblox gives users an enjoyable atmosphere, it can also lead to many risks.
",6
"Therefore, you bear the risk of becoming a victim of cyberbullying, online harassment, and other crimes.I disagree with several people who believe Roblox is a fantastic free-to-play game because you have to spend a considerable amount of money to obtain exceptionally good items in a single game.
",9
"Another reason why I don’t recommend Roblox to anyone is the amount of scams and hacks there are going around Roblox.
",2
"In the Roblox community, the topic of free robux is frequently discussed, and each day, thousands of hackers promote harmful websites providing 'free robux.
",8
"'The most popular frauds include ""Free robux generators"" and YouTube profiles with the name ""CLICK MY PROFILE FOR FREE ROBUX.

"""The next time you see Roblox on your home page, DELETE IT!

"Because David doesn't care about the community.

",6
"FESTIVE IS FOR CHRISTMAS NOT ARABS.

"Roblox added Indian servers but out of public demand and if I join them from my home country (Bahrain), they are such Bullcrap though they are the closest servers to my location and I am assuming this because they don't want Muslims to enjoy the game.

"If I type Arabic words without ( ُ َ ِ  ), IT WILL GET TAGGED BY THEIR SH*T MODERATION!

",7
"(Also sorry if i made typos im typing this on phone and im not natively english)
",3
"In my opinion this game is actually pretty good and child friendly but there can be predators on there because they can probably groom children’s and probably ask to go to discord which is not good for the kid if they are under 13 to go to discord but you can actually contact Roblox support to report the predator.

"and not to mention to dress your avatar you have to also pay robux to dress your avatar up and buy accessories in the avatar shop Which can’t be good for parents if they don’t have enough money to buy Robux and the moderation on Roblox Is a little bit bad because when you say the word “gay” on a game in chat and someone reports you you would get a 7 day ban or an account deletion which I find it messed up.

",3
"Also some people will say that parents can put restrictions on games, but that is are extremely hard and your kids would have to go into the game first and expose themselves to such disgusting content.

"most roblox games have too much pop ups/ads for a power up or something that you can only buy with real money and there's gambling in the game.

"The moderation is shit, bet they don't even read the reports I sent.
",6
"Now, the last thing:
",0
"
",0
"Violence.
",0
"The amount of violence on here.
",3
"Wouldn't recommend it.
",4
"If you want to look for a game with violence, play KAT or Arsenal.
",7
"It can be pretty toxic and unfriendly at times, and some games can highly frustrate the user based on who is in said server.
",9
"however, sometimes the community ruins it.
",1
"lastly, younger kids can sometimes make the playing experience unenjoyable for other players, so think twice before letting your little toddler create an account.
",7
"Roblox is downright SHADY.
",8
"It is a platform that takes advantage of children and child labor, as well as encourage children to gamble for cosmetic items, all to make Roblox more money.
",8
"Keep your children off this website, do not support its appalling buisness practices.
",4
"Most of it however, is community mad.
",2
"So if anything bad dose come from it, it will be moderated and age ratings can be applied.
",5
"Parents think it's not kid friendly but they're just dumb.
",7
"IT WONT LOAD FOR A WEEK STUPID GAME I CANT Play
",0
"The problem is the community.
",1
"Many players have negative intentions, creating violent games, uploading bypassed music and putting inappropriate images inside of their games.
",9
"Others can be pedophiles, scammers or downright bad people.
",8
"The biggest problem with all of this is Roblox itself, constant website, server, gameplay disruption, this isn't because of the games in Roblox its  just Roblox itself.
",6
"Roblox is a big company that is world wide now it shouldn't be messing up this much.
",9
"Roblox needs to just fix all the bugs in Roblox.
",3
"Its very disappointing to see games that people make a living off of not be available to play because of Roblox, and then Roblox not really completely fixing it.
",7
"It's impossible to generalize on these games.
",6
"You usually have to go out of your way to find inappropriate worlds, and there are some standalone situations in which someone is exposed to inappropriate content.
",9
"There are some assholes on this platform.
",0
"Roblox tends to swiftly tackle games in violation of their child-friendly rules.
",8
"I have been on Roblox multiple times, but the experience wasn't the best on some occasions.
",3
"There are too many toxic players in popular games (MeepCity for example).
",3
"There are people sending sexually explicit messages in the chat, and sexual roleplays.
",1
"There are even inappropriate outfits including pasties, lingerie, underwear, realistic breasts and other private body parts, or just making the avatar completely naked.
",3
"Another thing that bothers me is the bullying.
",9
"It's impossible to say anything without getting bullied by some random stranger you hardly know about.
",6
"And it's not just verbal either, some players go as far as to glitch your character in the ground or wall, or fling you around.
",7
"That brings me to another thing known as hackers and exploiters (people who download scripts from other websites to torment other players in game).
",8
"None of these people are getting banned or punished for it.
",9
"Speaking of which, the moderation is dog sh*t because nothing bad about the website is getting taken care of.
",8
"Games, players, accessories, and messages that violate the rules just stay there, and mods clearly don't give a crap.
",1
"Mods will only ban people over stuff that isn't even CLOSE to violating the  terms of service.
",2
"Hell, they ban people over trying to FIX Roblox's toxic atmosphere.
",2
"That's really only bad I have to say about Roblox.
",2
"Some games are violent, and I could watch out for that depending on what your child is allowed to see, but it isn't extremely violent to the point where someone is going to vomit or anything.
",5
"However, lots of the different games include violence, or other problematic things.
",8
"Another major problem, though, is that you are playing with absolutely anyone,  and anyone can talk to you.
",9
"It is quite difficult to say anything offensive or personal in the chat, such as emails, phone numbers, or swears, but there are loopholes that people DO quite often find.
",1
"There is an option to report people, but this is not very often the lead to anything actually happening about it.
",2
"Ok, so roblox so good and all, but, It does have a LOT of violence, Swearing, and other stuff, like online daters.
",2
"My child typed in the F word in the chat 60000000 times with some random bibba!
",1
"DON'T PLAY GAME!
",0
"SUCKS
",0
"I have been playing it for4 years now, And it's very easy to tell that you guys took one look at it and decided to write a scathing, lying review.
",0
"Do not blame Roblox for the games YOUR CHILD decided to play.
",5
"If your child plays a game and you don't like it, don't let them play it.
",7
"Don't blame Roblox for a violent game.
",3
"Do not blame Roblox for players that are rude.
",3
"THEY'RE the people
",1
"that should be reported.
",7
"And don't say people curse with numbers because they block numbers too.
",1
"Roblox does NOT ask for money.
",7
"So simply don't let them play them!!
",7
"Yes, there are bullies on Roblox.
",2
"But there's a little something called LEAVING THE GAME or BLOCKING THE PLAYER that you could do instead of blaming Roblox.
",7
"Roblox is not an addicting game, my child has never had any problems managing his time on Roblox.
",0
"And if Roblox just isn't the game for your child, DONT BLAME ROBLOX FOR THE FACT THAT YOUR CHILD DOSENT LIKE IT!!!
",7
"If you get scared your child is going to encounter a child predator, dont worry, words such as ""where do you live"" or ""whats your number"" and Numbers themselves all turn into ""###############"" .
",7
"Also, its super rare for something like this to happen, anyway.
",2
"The violence in roblox ISNT EVEN ACTUAL VIOLENCE.
",3
"There is no blood, no gore, just your character falling into pieces like lego characters.
",2
"There are settings you can change for both account safety and account privacy, one of them can restrict your child's ability to use the in-game chat feature, but that defeats half the purpose of roblox, i suggest only using this if your child has a real encounter with a child predator, creepy person, or your child is very young, like 4 or 5 years old.
",5
"CHILD.
",0
"So Roblox isnt to blame for games with cartoon violence or iffy stuff in the slightest.
",3
"Roblox tries very very hard to moderate their content and karens tend to not care.
",2
"The mods are embarrassing, a lot of 18+ stuff has been published in to the catalog page in the last few months , and some of them were removed after people reported them as NSFW.
",0
"I got banned on Roblox for naming an item, or whatever it is called ""aaaa"" since I was making a few of them for PFPs on games.
",6
"It was a small drawing of Tubbo from the Dream SMP and I got banned straight after posting it.
",0
"I'm disapointed that they banned me for the stupidest reason, and not banning others for doing way worse like doing s3xual things in-game, or swearing, etc.
",5
"I use to love this game as a kid but now it's banning people for the most stupid reasons.
",1
"Smh.
",0
"There have been some games that are violent .
",3
"And people can be rude in chat but you can disable chat.
",1
"Now, Roblox does have its problems.
",6
"Most of the time, these are just 10 year olds, so make sure your child is well educated enough to know that they should not do that.
",7
"Now sometimes people try to upload innapropiate things like... well you should know.
",2
"This gets past moderation most of the time because the game moderation in terms of clothes suck.
",6
"Now im not gonna say its GOOD cause you cannot say the words ""age"" or ""from"" sometimes.
",7
"The only words that are some people consider swearing (I do not) are Hell and idiot.
",1
"If your child is over 13 they maybe will see some swearing but very rarely.
",7
"However, there are some games that are somewhat innapropiate.
",8
"Keep in mind that robux is heavily overpriced, if you spend 10 dollars you get 800 robux which is not a lot to get much things since there are things in this game that cost $100-$50000.
",6
"will roblox is a game but some of the updates are bad
",1
"There are some players that are really toxic and online date, they call themselves slenders.
",2
"They are around 12 to 15 years old and they act like depressed people.
",4
"They try to make deep voices and always get mad over losing usually.
",8
"They will always try to bypass the chat to swear.
",1
"If a slender is in ur server u can just block him and play ignoring him, if he starts to ruin ur experience by glitching or exploiting just join another server, there are also games that are called condo, they are about sex but get deleted very very quick, they can be found in discord servers.
",5
"Its a good game for kids above kids but there are alot of bad people on this web who bypass the chat filter system and swear in it and sometimes ppl play songs which has swearing in it and alot of people online date in it
",1
"So many parents hate roblox because they have never tried it before.
",6
"In the parent community there is too much misinformation  so they dont understand but some but not many parents do.
",4
"Bad moderation
",2
"Now i am not criticizing the moderators or anything, i respect the fact that they work hard and stuff, but most roblox mods are lazy people who only care about the money/robux and ban randomly.
",2
"Now one time i was playing a game on roblox and a mod teleported to me and banned me for A YEAR.
",0
"Not all mods are bad but most of them ARE.
",2
"Bad safe chat
",1
"Now I understand the fact that safe chat is there to protect kids from cuss words, but i have seen so many cuss words and I NEVER use them.
",1
"Parents say that when kids see bad words they will say them immediately, but not all kids are like that.
",1
"So it is just easier if parents see curse words, they can just tell the kid to NOT USE THEM.
",7
"I never understood this logic.
",9
"Also it tags random words that are harmless and it also tags NUMBERS as well, forcing players to use ROMAN NUMERALS.
",1
"Toxic community members.
",2
"I have played so many games where 5 year olds cuss and generally be a bad sport whenever they are spanked by a professional.
",1
"These kids are generally being a bad sport but most kids are better than that.
",4
"But it is very, VERY overpriced because ten USD (around 14 CAD) gives you only 800 robux that kids can spend in 5 minutes.
",6
"Overprotective parental controls
",1
"The parental controls are VERY restrictive.
",1
"They make people unable to chat with the unfortunate kids that have these controls enabled and these kids cant chat AT ALL.
",1
"This makes it so hard to communicate.
",6
"He then placed down very bad towers and i couldn’t get him to stop and i ended up losing the round.
",0
"Racism
",0
"
",0
"Now many people talk about these slenders and say they are bad because they choose specific avatar items.
",3
"I think this is bad because the roblox community should be equal and nobody should face discrimination because of the kind of clothes or accessories they wear.
",3
"Also people that have free clothes are targeted snd bullied by 6 yr olds that have LOTS of robux.
",1
"Parents have to understand that not all of roblox are greedy moderators, hackers, and mean players.
",4
"I saw in chat DISTURBING things!!
",1
"My #### hurts.
",0
"How do people know that those arent adults.....
",3
"I am of German ethnicity and I was banned for speaking German claiming that I was insulting someone's ethnicity like what the hell this was my go to game when I was bored I am getting sick of the site and their lousy mods: Parents if your kid speaks their exclusive home countries language don't let them play the mods are lousy and will most likely ban them for no reason.
",1
"It is a good game, but it does have some flaws.
",2
"Multiple times my friends have told me about bullying in the chat system.
",0
"Why do parents think it's a bad game to play?
",2
"I got grounded because they think it's a bad game to play...but how?
",0
"Can someone give me an explanation on how it's bad?
",6
"I'm 17 years old and my parents think it's bad for me.
",0
"It's not fair!!
",7
"I need a better explanation on how it's so bad to play?
",6
"Are my parents wrong?
",0
"it has some bad stuff i keep seeing people have sex and being naked and saying bad words and hacking!
",1
"Also there a thing called condos and i didn't know what they were so i joined one and there were bad parts also theres to many scams!
",3
"they keep banning ppl for being lbtq its horblre i hate it!
",7
"Now, a lot of the other reviews will say that their child is being bullied, or getting invited to friends houses that they met in Roblox, there is a way to turn both of those off.
",4
"Don’t listen to them.
",6
"If you don’t want your child talking to people, turn their chat off!
",7
"If you don’t want them spending things on your account, simply don’t give them your credit card credentials.
",7
"Roblox's moderaton is failing and letting bad stuff go in it, and so much scammers and hackers
",8
"I love roblox but this t has a chat and if you would like to you can disable the chat so they can’t use it.
",7
"However there are many toxic players.
",2
"There is some sexual games made by players but they get taken down very quickly and they never get popular so it's unlikely your child will find a sexual content on roblox.
",8
"There are weapons and you can die in game but the death isn't glrey or bloody it just looks like Lego charachters falling down.
",3
"Certain aspects on the game parents may be uncomfortable with is: horror games, (usually mild) violence, (usually censored) bad language from other players, bullying, the chance of your child giving away private info.
",1
"LONG STORY SHORT JUST TEACH YOUR CHILD HOW TO BE NICE ONLINE AND TO NOT GIVE AWAY PRIVATE INFORMATION!
",0
"For example the game, ""Adopt me"" Personally, I've never played it seriously for a good period of time but due to the game's young audience, it has become a cesspool of scamming.
",3
"Even worse, some impressionable kids become themselves scammers sometimes.
",8
"I've also been scammed once by a scamming game and lost my account, though this only happened due to me being very young at the time.
",0
"Another thing, sexual content is also extremely rare, I've played Roblox since 2014 and have seen only 2 instances of sexual places (I've seen some sexual content due to hackers, but since Filtering Enabled was added to every game, it has completely disappeared).
",1
"You have to be specifically looking for these places to find them and if they reach over 10 players, they get terminated in 30 minutes.
",6
"There are though a less sexual but still bad community of players in Roblox that try to bypass the filter.
",1
"But as long as you monitor your child you can just ban them from playing the game that is populated with these people or warn them about them.
",7
"As long as the account age is under 13, basically nothing will get through, and even if it does your child needs to know context of what they're bypassing to understand it most of the time.
",7
"HI i like this game but some people are just STRAIT SALTY OR JUST WEIRD.
",2
"as a 9 year old playing roblox (i have permission form my parents), i have no idea why it's 13+, unless u specifically search for bad stuff, it wont show up.
",0
"And the other hacking which is the meep city hacking which was just a security problem that the developer never fixed and allowed a lot of hackers with bad intentions to get into his game but it was fixed within around 4 to 5 days and the next thing is that there is a thing called robux which is the games form of currency and there is also a lot of scamming with it with younger kids who dont know what they are doing so just watch out for that but as I was saying most of these news stations and that are tryi
",8
"Also another thing to point out is that the moderation is like ridiculous not in like that sort of fashion like its really bad but like some of the automatic things is just ridiculous like accounts are getting terminated and getting a few day bans for saying words like the single word gay and nothing else and stuff like that there is a whole thing of things talking about the moderation of actual experienced players who have been on the website for a long time that just absolutely expose them but dont be afr
",2
"Soo parents are saying that roblox isnt for kids well i am one of the kids and id say that i am just bad at school not because of roblox but because i dont want to go study.
",3
"I would say just monitor your children more and not confiscate any of their devices sure there is blood in games but dont let your children play  those games.
",8
"People never told me mean things because im kind of a friendly guy but if they do say mean things there should be a leaderboard just tap their name and click block and their messages dont appear.
",5
"The only time you will find inappropriate content for kids is if you deliberately look for it off site, as roblox will most likely ban it with their great moderation system.
",4
"Roblox is literally made for kids.
",2
"Pedophiles are rare and over-exaggerated on Roblox.
",2
"There are “condo games” which are games Roblox has (they try to ban these games) that contain sexual acts, Roblox tries to ban these games and the players in them, sex is not tolerated at all on roblox.
",1
"There are many cons though, such as the consumerism, violent games, suggestive content, swearing, and TERRIBLE servers.
",4
"As of typing this review, the site is currently offline because of a major outage.
",9
"They said its good but dont click  bad games.
",3
"But there are some downsides, too.
",2
"The website/games can lag or glitch, most items can only be paid with an online currency called 'Robux' you can only pay for with real-life money, and since it is a public chat, moderation is not the best, and there are over a billion players so I've seen lots of bullying, swearing, and players chatting sexual jokes and using animations to look like they are doing sexual acts.
",1
"Some games can be scary, have mild swearing, models supposed to be alcohol, or dark themes so be careful.
",8
"However, even though it is aimed for kids, there is quite a lot of inappropriate stuff that is likely to disturb kids.
",2
"The violence is not major, but there are uses of weapons, explosions, and some blood.
",1
"Some Roblox games are based off violent TV shows, one example is Squid Game.
",3
"Sexual innuendo includes pornographic avatars and very stereotyped girl games.
",3
"my dad lets me play roblox and usally some kids might put the wrong age thats why they join wierd servers with wierd people actually in it but ive joined brookhaven never had a problem its just that my sister got hacked thats why bc ppl usally hack ppl with robux and if ur kid has that please be careful
",4
"If you raised your child like a naughty, ignorant, and rule breaking menace.. Don't get this game, you'll end up seeing them trying to swear at innocent robloxians, and they will always curse, curse and curse and be sooo annoying, and.. yeah they will become different, everyday they will be asking for 100 pounds worth of robux, and a premium roblox membership, you will go bankrupt!
",1
"They will also find some inappropriate games if you allow  them to access social media.
",5
"But back to children, a smart child wont beg you for 304000032098498249842 robux EVERY Day, maybe like 4 pound every month, week?
",3
"But.. don't spoil them to much, or they'll get attatched and turn into...

"THE DEVIL, THE DARK DEEP DEVIL WHO ALWAYS LOCKS THERE DOOR EATING READY SALTED WALKERS AND LEAVING CRUMBS ON THERE DEVICE WHILSTE SWEARING AT THERE MESSY PHONE BECAUSE THEY DIED IN MURDER MYSTERY 2!!!!!!
",0
"i has sinned me out of my account 30 times and now its down and on the jailbreak privet server its nearly imposable
",5
"For example some games may contain some gore.
",3
"And some contain sexual content.
",3
"But are banned quickly.
",2
"And be careful with your child's account because some predators may be on there.
",7
"And mild cursing is allowed on roblox.
",1
"Robolx suck because of it's severs.
",6
"But the truth is that Roblox is a toxic platform.
",1
"It has a lot of toxic players who are harming kids life.
",3
"Most of all, Roblox has the worlds worst sever system.
",6
"Every time when Roblox is down It will take 6 years just to fix the sever.
",6
"Roblox is in a tradic state and it should not be avertisting to kids.
",5
"If any of these parents ever read the TOS, it says that if your child spends money using your card without parental consent, there account will be banned.
",7
"So like stop complaining about it just cause you didn't read the TOS.
",7
"I wouldn't recommend turning off their chat though because your child could become anti-social as a result of that.
",5
"I admit some content is inappropriate, and it usually takes moderation a little bit to remove it, but most of this content can only be found by searching for it DIRECTLY.
",1
"You should at least give them a talk every once and a while about online safety and predators and how they should only be friends with people they know.
",7
"Also, dont buy ANYTHING from any game that says that it will give you the item in the ORIGINAL game.
",5
"It's not their fault if you got addicted and you have bad grades.
",7
"That's for the kids who say they forgot their password.
",9
"Also, the bullying is a problem, but you can easily block those players altogether.
",1
"And Roblox isn't a pay to win game.
",7
"That's all I have to say about this app.
",2
"And it also had people all over the world who make the different game son roblox, and some can be violent or inappropriate for some ages.
",0
"There's a extremely low chance you'll get exposed to something bad.
",9
"Roblox has safe chat by the way so people can't say anything bad worser than ""Idiot"" and ""hell"".
",1
"This game has very trash events guys dont play it!
",2
"First: Good privacy, can't type any swears, names, or numbers over 2 digits (for phone number privacy)
",4
"Second: you get bullies and sexual content in games made for kids....fuck humans.
",1
"While the game is made for young kids, I am forced to date it a 12 as the people too old for it and too cheap to buy Minecraft just ruin it for the kids..could be a pretty great app.
",4
"I used to play this all the time- eventually gave up.
",6
"Don’t get me wrong, there are some AMAZING games on there, but roblox itself is annoying.
",3
"They keep adding new rules that make it harder to play and reducing value of the things you buy with real money, they steal money.
",8
"Some games people make on there have really terrible sex content, as I’ve experienced second-hand when my friend stumbled across a game where characters were doing disgusting things.
",8
"Also, roblox events suck.
",6
"Negative Qualities:
",0
"I actually enjoy ROBLOX but the platform is becoming worse.
",6
"It's inappropriate and ROBLOX has a horrible moderation team which causes children to be exposed to explicit content.
",1
"Inappropriate assets can pass though moderation but not something that is perfectly okay.
",2
"There are lots of false bans but they are only reversed from community outrage meaning, there are tons of people who have been falsely banned and are stuck like that.
",2
"ROBLOX does have a report system but it is unreliable and it does almost nothing.
",2
"There are also lots of scammers which can lead to hacking and a sad child.
",8
"ROBLOX has been releasing updates that are useless and aren't focusing on the more serious problems.
",1
"Final statement:
",0
"The negative qualities outweigh the positive ones, which makes ROBLOX bad.
",2
"There are too many hackers in this game pls stop them
",4
"So I was playing bedwars and this person told me to ""mic up"" damn, this kid had the stitchface, korblox, and some cringy emo shirt, so I got his discord, and he sounded about, 10, all I said was hi, he left the call.
",0
"BUT, They Get Deleted Within 10 Hours Of Me Sending A Service Report.
",4
"Roblox Will Also Soon Be Age-Rating Games, And Parents REALLY Need To Stop Complaining About Bypassing Swear Words, YOU LITERALLY LEARN THEM AT SCHOOL, And Children Swear Left And Right When You Don't Know About It.
",0
"They also think they are grown and mature so they can be very annoying if you or your child find one it is preferable to avoid them.
",7
"Don’t add strangers because that just common sense.
",7
"The only things I dislike about it is the consumerism and the chat.
",8
"There is nothing wrong with having chat in a game, but there is a lot of inappropriate text in chat.
",1
"The consumerism is also terrible.
",8
"I know some for my friends spend up to $90 a week on this so called currency called “robux”.
",0
"I have robux but I rarely ever get it.
",6
"I think roblox is sometimes toxic bc there r slenders and c&p's there really toxic but some of them arent its better if u leave ur kids be tho.
",3
"AND ROBLOX U BETTER NOT ADD REALISTIC THINGS ITS GOING TO BE WAY TOO ANNOYING
",0
"Roblox has a horrible system for paying their developers, many games don't even make money if you don't pay Roblox first and Roblox takes an enormous cut of the pay anyways.
",1
"roblox is a really good game its just annoying how it sensors some of the dumbest things.
",2
"i could misspell a word then it would tag out, a lot of the time it also tags out numbers
",1
"Make sure to have a good password don’t trust the peaple offering free robux hackers are common but Roblox let’s you report explorers bully’s ect.
",3
"There are scammers so teach your kids how to not get scammed..I reccommend dont buy premium for 5-7 yr old kids and tell them to spend their robux cause if they get hacked it is all gone and even worse if you buy premium!
",4
"Only things to look out for is like any social media, hackers and pred*tors.
",1
"It’s good but there is some inappropriate games on it and some people try do do things with you that are not very cool.
",1
"The ""safe chat"" thing doesn't work, lots of toxic people are there.
",2
"Some youtubers even got cyberbullied.
",0
"And the graphics are not good without rtx.
",3
"And your kids will rage if you don't give them robux.
",7
"I'm playing roblox myself and I think that some games are pretty brutal to play, these games are like 10+ or 11+.
",3
"But there are scammers all around roblox but it isent robloxes falt that there are scammers they are just evil persons!
",9
"That was my review, have fun with roblox and dount get scammed!
",9
"I am concerned about this game.
",7
"This game can have a downside as there is a LOT of social interactions and chatting.
",2
"Violence has been present in lots of games, too, from strange cartoony swords to high-graphic (close to real life) shooters.
",2
"If you are under 13, either do not get this game or speak to your parents and consider playing it with 'limited' features.
",7
"This game has nothing immoderately inappropriate.
",2
"But games like Arsenal have guns in them that make it a bit more like Fortnite which is PEGI 12 and it’s violent.
",3
"And they censor bad language in the chat.
",1
"the games are all fine and fun but it is really EASY to disconnect and you always get reported for no reason.
",2
"And when  you get reported and it works, YOU GET KICKED OUT OF THE GAME!!!
",0
"I once got kicked and got a warning while I was in a tower defence game for 40 minutes when I was just about to win.
",0
"If you are swearing it is usually tagged, but my friend got banned for swearing in tags BRUH.
",1
"Most of the games are just pure trash.
",3
"Very little entertain me.
",3
"Just stop clouding up the games that just suck, making it hard to find games that are fun.
",8
"As the title says the site can be a little iffy.
",5
"It has blood and gore but not the graphics in like Call of Duty or something.
",3
"They are modern goths that act like pedo's and online date.
",1
"The worse one's are toxic and play games like AA:TT or something like that.

",4
"First of all scams.
",2
"Even tho u dont need barly a brain just to know that scams are bad people under 8 can do stuff like that.
",8
"The good thing about these scams if after you fall for it the first time you won't do it agin.
",7
"Also there would be many raging kids if there were people under 8 (even 8 do rage).

",3
"Basically, the Roblox moderation system is absolute garbage.
",9
"If you report a single account, any one, it could even be your friends, Roblox will take action without reviewing the report itself and terminate the account.
",6
"And if they try to appeal, it will be denied with a botted message that repeats the same thing over and over again with no chance of appeal.

"0/10, would not recommend.
",4
"I've spent hours upon hours playing, working my way up and finally got my dream item just to be falsely accused of ""account theft"" with no chance of appeal.

"It is a fun game but throughout the years the platform has become very toxic.

"The players date in ""roleplay"" games and are able to find ways to play inappropriate audios.
",1
"There are also scam bots and hackers that can give your computer a virus, etc.

"The only thing I don't think I can give them credit for is the amount of in game microtransactions the different games have, I don't think I should blame it all on Roblox because the developers put them in.

"The moderation is terrible for a multi billion game corporation with it's CEO being a multi billionaire, they are improving on moderation... barely... per month.

"Here are the downsides of roblox.
",2
"There are, unfortunately, quite a few players who try to date on roblox.
",4
"The biggest issue with that is the constant problem of cybergrooming, not just on roblox, but on all online platforms 
",6
"-in app purchases.
",9
"these parents are going crazy out of roblox because it has like games that have guns and bloood that isnt real Like really?
",2
"And many people can get hacked easily.
",1
"Also some games have blood images included.
",3
"I used 100 dollars on robux and wasted it all on my avatar!
",6
"Was gonna give it age 5 and up but u know u can easily get scammed so i guess that 10 year olds wouldn't be as vulnerable idk
",4
"so nothing that is not all-ages gets quashed before anyone even knows they exist.
",6
"Also almost no capacity for violence over ""funny bonk hammer"", because look at the avatars.
",9
"Little Lego men who's arms and legs pop off when they die.
",8
"So basically I spent the rest of my robux on a t shirt and it got del8ted and I didn't get my robux back and it was 10 robux so I'm really mad
",0
"Your kid should know about internet safety, and if they don’t, then you basically can’t play any game.
",7
"The chat filter won’t allow users to share any private information.
",1
"It is a bit too strict.
",2
"Its a terrible website with bad moderators who can't protect children from slurs I recommend staying away from this website
",2
"Most parents that complain about roblox not being safe they usually think roblox is the same game it used to be in 2016 but roblox is alot safer than it used to be(There are still dodgy things happen like any social platform)
",5
"You can get banned for saying a word, that is meaningless and they'll take it to the extreme.
",9
"It was never liked this, but something changed to Roblox.
",0
"The service and support is absolutely terrible.
",6
"I've had to fix problems on my own like getting my old account back, they didn't even help one bit.
",0
"I got one thing to say, when you grow up, expect to be disappointed.
",7
"Worse ping optimization.
",2
"if you are looking for a fun, exciting, safe, and interactive game ROBLOX is not for you.
",9
"They steal money their developers and refuse to put it into good things such as servers.
",4
"Instead they pout out rushed Rthro packages and events.
",4
"The only good games (criminality and town) are horribly optimized in terms of ping everyone can run ping tests and get 100 or below, but the billion-dollar platform refuses to update their servers and only favors developers that rake more layers into their repetitive boring games instead of gems that are highly rated.
",2
"Again, not worth your time on this platform
",6
"The problem is, the thing the kid is doing on it might be bad.
",2
"But, some of the games on that platform might not be suitable for kids, because other people create the games.
",3
"I wanted to change it but roblox said no.
",0
"Please fix this.
",6
"I know that it has some iffy content, BUT HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY, DON'T BLAME ROBLOX!!!!!!!
",8
"Some kids trying to act ""big and bad"" make these kind of things.
",7
"not the game.
",4
"This is not meant to be another GTA, It's meant to be a safe kid friendly plantform to make and play games, teens may have messed up the game but you know what to avoid.
",4
"Roblox just isn't the same anymore.
",9
"Roblox now cares about money and thats the reason Roblox is stopping their most cared events like the egg hunt.
",1
"They have lame excuses for this kind of stuff.
",1
"ROBLOX IS NOT A GAME IT'S A PLATFORM OF GAMES.
",0
"These do get banned so don't expect to make this your everyday avatar.
",5
"Media is way too hard to bypass.
",1
"If its not yet taken action nobody can see it.
",2
"The easiest way to bypass this is just get lucky and get a dumb as hell moderator to accept your image or well pay them
",9
"This will still get moderated if it gets reported.
",5
"The only way you can find bypassed stuff is if you actually try and look at the dark side of Roblox.

"2.BULLIES!!

"Parents, be warned as some of the games like ""Murder Mystery 2"" and ""Arsenal"" contain violence and hackers so parents, be careful about what they play.
",3
"then roblox started to be a bit questionable.
",0
"sometimes you would get a warning or ban for something ridiculous, mobile support is really really bad, so i suggest playing on a computer.
",6
"even then, you will disconnect probably because of all the data and lag building up.

"Games follow the same format over and over, it gets repetitive.
",9
"If possible, avoid and potentially BAN this game from your house.

"THIS GAME IS TOO HARD!
",0
"A few things to note before downloading:
",2
"
",0
"1: TOO MUCH ""BUY ROBUX AND YOU WILL GET THIS""
",0
"2: A LOT of scams for robux and your account password
",5
"3: If your childs account gets hacker they probably will be in tears for a month
",6
"4: If you don't use money, your child will look very bad in the game no matter what
",7
"5: If they have a 5 year/older device roblox will crash and won't work

"A bit more to mention but it would get boring then....

"Moderation
",0
"This game is moderated poorly...

",2
"THIS IS A KIDS GAME.
",0
"Since when should platform for kids be talking about sexuallity?
",7
"Now let's finally talk about scams...
",0
"There are so many robux scammers on this website it has become a meme at this point.. Roblox doesn't do much to stop scam bots from taking advantage of children.
",9
"It's understandable there are THOUSANDS of them and it can be hard to track them all, but I feel like the Roblox moderation team is lazy at times.
",8
"Just put restrictions on their account and monitor them and WHILE THERE is inappropriate stuff such as condos, Bypassed Music and with glitches people can actually bypass the filter and say swear words.
",1
"Its still only a small percentage and the roblox corporation is slowly banning them
",2
"this game is great but i have some issues.
",2
"Firstly i was on a group idk the name and this dude was saying Sex with my please like what the-(dont wanna say it).
",0
"Secondly some ppl literally hav fake sex in the game like i dont know names but yeah.
",7
"I don't recommend playing phantom forces if you are like under 10 just please check your games to your age!
",3
"my not mad at roblox you know condos are dont look it up
",3
"its not roblox doing this it the playeryou pernetsout there dont get mad at roblox get mad at users roblox i  not create this sex roblox is trying to ban them it users get mad at the dirty users
",7
"my account just got deleted
",0
"First of all this game can't even be played consistently.
",0
"It disconnects you even if you have good internet status.
",5
"Every single day there has to be at least one stupid glitch that Roblox is too ignorant to fix.
",1
"Then there are these useless ""upgrades"" that don't do anything but waste your time.
",6
"Roblox used to be good but now it's a very bad game.
",2
"Honestly pathetic.
",0
"Not recommended for someone who wants to have an enjoyable gaming experience.
",6
"the app is really good, but its really inappropriate and people can easily get around the tag system so they can still say bad words and it is an unhealthy experience for kids 15- and people also online date on roblox and some people make fun of how people dress their avatars
",1
"Other's about this is the toxicity, so there are some toxic mean people who like to wear the avatar item called the stitchface, they are called slenders.
",3
"(This has happened to me in the past where BESTGAMERS582 did it) They are also very toxic in bypassing the chat with swear words.
",1
"the only bad things about roblox are the chat censor witch just censors things like hi, bypassed audio and just things you would expect to see in a game with aufull moderation.
",1
"seriosly though the moderation sucks, oh yeah, also slenders and teamers in games like mm2.
",2
"those guys are annoying, oh yeah and ro-gangtsers too, and trolls but those guys  are OK not annoying just OK.
",2
"This is a very good game for kids but parents are mad about everything here,there might be some very gory games that are too inappropriate for children,but most of it is safe and fine,you can turn on a setting that only shows games that are suitable for the age,there might be a false report of you,roblox moderation is bad sometimes,but theres a rare chance you will be banned forever,as that only is common for really old accounts,and the censoring system is good,so the f word will so up as ####,even though i
",2
"Roblox is a great game, but there are a few problems.
",2
"Chat is the big #1 on the list because of possible security problems.
",9
"The chat can induce predators to pretend they are younger, and get your phone number, and come to your house.
",7
"If kids have your credit card, they can put you in debt.
",7
"I'm an Normal Teen that it's an roblox Veteran, but, OH MY GOD when i know that roblox has some hackiing issues, Like, really, You randomly Log out and the passcode gets changed, that happened always to my Sister, but got resolved, Still, after that, Roblox it's still an great game, fun, but watch out about the hackers, and always report to Roblox

"there are hackers, scammers, and cons in this game.
",6

",8
"The players on Roblox can be not what you expected.

"You will find extremely crappy games, and also excellent ones.

"I cant even say what the frick.
",1
"I got terminated for saying gay, I never got banned for exploiting.
",0
"Roblox tolerates exploiters quite well, but saying gay is absolutely 0 tolerance no matter who you are.
",2
"I dont really support LGBT because well, im a christian and well, i see it unfair how we as christians cant say our opinions or we will get banned.
",9
"I just wanna make it clear i dont intend to offend any lgbt person out there, but its sad how we either cant say anything or we just have to say stuff in their favor.

"Back in 2017-2018 you could get banned just for saying ""da wae"" because it was ""racist"" even tho the uganda community didnt mind it.
",5
"Also one person got banned for simply saying lego.
",0
"Thats how bad moderation is.
",2
"Roblox has more negativity than positivity.
",9
"Reason
",0
"The game itself has many unsatisfactory people.
",1
"Like bullies, scammers, hackers, online daters and even gangsters.
",2
"A player may bully your children causing so many problems, depression and insecurity.
",1
"Scammers
",0
"Of course, so many young players trust “free Robux”.
",8
"A player will scam the victim by changing the victim’s password on the account.
",5
"It is very likely to happen to kids that trust scammers.
",7
"In trading, it is most likely to happen that your children can lose a limited item because of the scammers.
",6
"Beware of this.
",2
"Bullies
",0
"Of course, there is a MASS of people who bully and show off.
",8
"A player may say something like “u are ugly” or “u are stupid and idiot” to the victim.
",1
"A player will probably even report your children’s account for no reason.
",5
"If a player said “I like you” or “let’s have secs (sex)” to your children, your child/ren must leave the game as soon as possible.
",6
"Sometimes the community is just impolite as it is.
",8
"Your children may experience one of the bad things in the game.
",1
"Unfortunately, your children can’t get rid of unsatisfactory people.
",1
"But be careful, your child may be bullied by a user on Discord as well.
",5
"That outfit might disappear or the creator of the outfit deletes it but here I am not able to use a lot of my outfits and I didn’t get refunded for any of it.
",2
"There are people who can be rude with the following: scamming, bullying.
",1
"People use words such as:  b*tch a** and more words that can be uncomfortable for some.
",1
"Also if someone swears at you it comes up in hashtags.
",7
"Overall it is a great games, BUT WAIT, there are just a few things in Roblox that just suck : Robux is the online currency of the game, while you think you don't need Robux, people start bullying you and may also harass  you, your kids need to be safe with the stuf of revealing your private information, which is a huge no-no, overall, it is a great game and I am fine it with.
",5
"It is a bit annoying that so much costs robux.
",6
"Chat is censored so no one can curse or say anything vulgar.
",1
"However, nowadays, it's a bit... concerning.
",0
"I've seen 9 year olds online dating, bullying for having no robux (which is ingame money which you have to pay for, 4.99 for 500 robux.
",4
"), swearing, sexting, etc.
",0
"There are a few games that are vulgar (blood and such) such as FPS and horror games.
",1
"Violence is prevalent in some games, however it is not over the top and blood is hardly shown, except for horror games.
",3
"Now onto the negatives:
",1
"Roblox has a lot of issues in the community.
",1
"Trollers are players who deliberately go out of their way to put others down and bully other players for their own benefit because they think it is funny.
",4
"Unfortunately the trolling community in roblox is high.
",9
"Condos are games that are made by players which are sexual.
",1
"Condos are very hard to find, unless you go to websites such as discord looking for them.
",5
"Robux costs a lot of money, and if someone doesn't have robux they will probably be bullied for the way their avatar looks, as a roblox player who didn't have robux for a long time I experienced this.
",6
"Roblox oders, disgusting- 
",0
"As a child with a loss of innocence-, roblox oders are the problem and literal games that are inappropriate.
",2
"I remember seeing my friend play one and I joined and I was disgusted and disappointed.
",0
"I think you should not let your child chat, in the setting you can turn it on to off.
",7
"And one more thing, since I’ve lost a lot of innocence... you should do something, check your child’s chats & recently played games.
",0
"Recently I have been banned in Roblox because I defended myself from a person who called me a fag.
",0
"Roblox didn't do anything to that person, and I got banned.
",6
"I have just came out of the closet and that kind of stuff makes me feel like I'm alone and gives me bad thoughts.
",0
"Anyway, Roblox can be good, but you should really be careful of the bad people on there.
",2
"It only becomes addicting and inappropriate if you make out to be like that.

"2 It doesn't save your progress at all

"3 Some games that are not for kids at all (shooting and killing games)
",3
"it i sso bad, it always has connection issues, and you can getvirus they wont ever fix system they just blame it on the the players and the people who make the when in reality it is just thej robglx devs fault, dont paly this gamerbeage game.

"Okay you have got to be kidding me!

"If you aren’t okay with your kid playing games with consumerism, you might want to stop them from playing any tycoon game.
",7
"That chat is censored as well.
",1
"I've been playing for 4 years,and the moderation has always been a bit off.Please watch your child while playing,and if you think it's risky,please turn chat off.This reduces the risk of encountering a child predator,and it's extremely rare too.Sometimes reports don't go through.Parents tend to take one look at a news report and BOOM!They think it's dangerous.Some games spam you with gamepasses and try to scam you.All i'm saying is,be careful.

"To wrap up my review,monitor your child while playing,and please take action if you think it is too risky.Don't blame roblox if you let a child predator has personal information about your child.Blame yourself.

"TL,DR Roblox is a cool game but has some flaws like scammers and other rude people
",2
"
",0
"Also why are you wasting your time looking at a 10 year old rambling about a lego game for 10 freaking minutes?
",6
"I also see some bad words being used in games.
",1
"i think roblox is horrible.
",2
"roblox is bad because i can't log into my account and i am 100% sure the username and password is correct.
",5
"when it doesn't log me in it says something like we are having trouble with logging you in.
",0
"and when i go on my computer and try to get help there is no answer for what i should do.
",0
"so that is why roblox is the worst game ever made.
",6
"I wanted to log into my account and I can't get back in because I don't have an email to put in so now I'm locked out thanks Roblox.
",0
"The chat filters out bad language, though you can still be mean in it, but the violence is very cartoonish and sex is pretty rare, though not excluded.
",1
"The only other concern I would have is that Roblox is quite bad for hacking, but it's still a very rare occurrence and usually doesn't leak private information.
",2
"Some players are rude, toxic and inappropriate.
",2
"Like when I ask people in the Roblox game MM2, they become toxic to me.
",5
"The players also swear a lot.
",1
"Also the chat filter is too strict.
",1
"Also the community became more toxic in recent years.
",9
"However, here comes the major downside and the reasoning behind me never really recommending ROBLOX to anyone.
",8
"The moderation system on roblox has been quite an issue for multiple years.
",6
"Mass bans, declined/thrown away appeals, almost irrational reasoning behind banning/terminating, you name it.
",8
"Roblox mods just seem to lack the passion for the game and the community, and are giving out punishments that are way too serious for the offense or are questionable.
",4
"Roblox itself doesn't seem to care too much, after all, they just need the money and the users right?
",6
"Well in a way, yes, as most firms are, roblox also needs money and to me all of this bullshit with the roblox moderation is just a way for roblox to exploit more money out of users.
",2
"Roblox has time to time shown its potential to be a great game and step it up into the ""big league"" of games, but due to its incompetent moderators it has set a big blunder on its reputation.
",6
"I honestly have no idea when roblox will fix this issue or if they will fix it at all, but until then, do be prepared to wake up seeing your account terminated with the reason of ""offensive item: yes"".
",6
"parents, just because your character falls apart when it resets doesnt mean its gore.
",6
"its not roblox's fault adopt me has scams and online daters.

"the parents are only looking at the bad side of roblox.

"if your childs grades are dropping because of roblox, set a screen time limit for roblox instead of outright banning them from the laptop or phone or whatever.
",7
"just tell your kids to be safe around slenders and copy and pastes, as they can be really toxic and they online date.
",1
"A lot of people on the media like to focus on a few bad things that have happened.
",1
"the game have violence which i ignore.
",3
"A lot of comments I have seen are either incorrect, or people misunderstanding, so I'd like to clarify a few things.
",1
"First of all, roblox is entirely dependebt on the community, sure they might have bad moderation but it's probably a bit hard to moderate over half of the U.S's child population.
",2
"Second, I've seen many people talk about swearing and bullying, but there's a setting that lets you turn off the chat feature (to acess it click the gear in the top right corner and go to privacy).
",5
"Third, people complain about sexual content (which isn't roblox fault if you can remember the first thing I said.)
",7
"MONITORING YOUR CHILD.
",0
"Anyways, last but absolutely not least, people complain about people not recieving robux, (which again isn't roblox's fault) that's called a glitch, not a scam.
",9
"The problem is about the older kids bashing young kids about playing this game.
",9
"Another problem is the pricing.
",1
"Like c'mon $10 for 800 robux?
",6
"Kinda sad.
",0
"Free robux websites and apps can put viruses in you phone or pc.
",5
"Con's: 
",0
"Occasional Hackers
",0
"Robux is payed which can send wrong message.
",2
"stop being idiots and dont helicopter them.
",2
"Roblox isn't actually as bad as most parents make it out to be.
",1
"But, there is a bad side to it, though it makes up the minority of the platform.
",2
"There are ""condo"" games, which aren't child friendly and bypass moderation, but they barely exist anymore.
",1
"The only reason I rated it age 9 and up was because of that, and scamming (which is quite popular on Adopt Me, but also occurs on the site.
",3
"Some websites scam you into thinking you get free Robux, which is Roblox's in-game currency, but in reality they're just survey websites that waste your time and sometimes even steal your personal info or install malware on your computer).
",5
"I believe that a 9 year old who is aware of these problems would be mature enough to not go onto these websites and not fall for Adopt Me scams.
",4
"If there is a kid reading this, then just keep this in mind: you can't get free Robux, or free pets/currency in games like Adopt Me.
",7
"Security is also slightly flawed.
",1
"Recently I've seen some videos on devs getting SIM-swapped, which means someone getting your personal info and calling your phone/SIM provider whatchamacallit and acting like you to get access to your Roblox account before stealing everything on your account.
",5
"There are also some rude people in games, but if you encounter one, just click on their name in the leaderboard and click ""block user"" or type in the chat ""/mute (rude person's username)"" and you won't be able to see their chat messages, and if you block them they can't join your game.
",5
"Don't try and find those condo games since going to them will (most likely) get you banned from Roblox.
",7
"Don't click on any suspicious links or try and open pictures from their original link from third-party websites like Discord, since some people on there have a malicious intent and the link to the image can be a .xss link, which injects some malicious code into Roblox and could potentially compromise your account.
",4
"On concerns: 
",0
"While Roblox has a strict policy on profanity, drugs, and racism, that sadly doesn't stop everyone.
",2
"The swearing is prevented, but I have found a few problem (you can say the f word if you replace the U with an A).
",1
"I have found that if you do encounter the rare racist or jerk person, he is promptly reported and kicked.
",1
"The worst thing that happened was that I was hacked on m account a few years back and Roblox did nothing about it, I did not give away my password either like some kids are foolish to do, but they have gotten better and have learned to censor that too, I believe.
",0
"I'm kind of over it though because by now I know its too late for Roblox to fix m profile, all my clothes that i had and my remaining rubux was gone, just like that.
",0
"I miss the old days as well when roblox cafes were popular, some still are but its very few, I even own some groups, with whole cafes, and admin in the game, just haven't been able to get them back up again.
",6
"I understand parents want to keep their kids safe, but Roblox isn't the monster parents make it out to be.
",7
"I mean, there's many instances of poor moderation, like a not to long ago, back in early-mid 2020 a moderator got bribed for access to the moderation panel.
",6
"I think they should have moderation be more region based, a player can easily be banned by a moderator from a different country due to language barriers.
",3
"Roblox has it's issues, like it's toxic community (however, that can be said about any internet community) scammer, hackers and poor moderation and other issues that need to be addressed.
",2
"There is one thing I am a little concerned about...Online daters, commonly known as oders.
",3
"They are kids that pretend to have girlfriends and boyfriends.
",1
"There is no violence, just your character falling into pieces while making an ""Oof"" sound.
",2
"if the game makes your kid do something stupid its not the games fault its your fault as a parent.
",7
"But the servers sometime crash,  But it is not a big of an issue any more.
",4
"The reason why I think its for kids 10+ is because there are some violent games and sometimes people swear.
",3
"So Roblox is a great site, but there are some downsides/safety concerns.
",2
"i was on a game on roblox and some dude hacked the game, he kicked everyone out except me, they muted me and threatened to track my ip and rape me.
",0
"I left the game terrified.
",0
"I went on an alt  account to keep playing Roblox and they somehow knew it was me and harassed me on every game.
",0
"I eventually left Roblox after reporting them for the 5th time and nothing happened.
",6
"Over all Roblox is great, but its some of the people on there that need to be banned who ruin it for everyone.
",2
"First off, I play roblox and still does but not that much anymore (most game innit are lazily made and will always have bug lol).
",0
"As the title said, the problem with this 'game' (you can call it a client or whatever) is that there's too much dirty minded lil child.
",4
"Why is this a problem?
",2
"Well you see, those dirty minded children would make a game like 'scented con' or sometime they would bypass the system just to make these kind of inappropriate online dating game.
",4
"Roblox can't detect it because they frequently make a new server once Roblox ban the game.
",7
"Not only that, this 'game' is also full of pedophile.
",2
"They usually bait children by asking them to add as friend and make them join certain game.
",9
"All of this can make your child a dirty minded bastard.
",9
"So I can't recommend this game to any children or teen younger than 16.
",4
"ROBLOX is really that bad and here is why.
",2
"Usually the people who write 18+ ROBLOX reviews are Karens who are cruel and overprotective of their kid.
",4
"What I'm trying to get at here is that ROBLOX isn't that much of a bad game, it's just the people who create the games can either make or break the child.
",8
"So beware of some games (I'm sounding like a Karen and I apologize).
",3
"um so i go on game and it has innapropate so shud no plae.
",5
"srry
",1
"They are a reputably poor service, but I would still advise reaching out to them if something goes wrong in your child’s experience on Roblox.
",5
"Swearing is not the only thing that tags- words and phrases like “age,” “I hate you,” “sucks,” and “going to kill” all become tags for accounts thirteen and under.
",1
"Along with this, inappropriate things (e.g.
",1
"Roblox has a some problems, there is a chance of finding inappropriate content.
",1
"Since users are allowed to create their own custom generated game, there is a chance players will use this power for evil.
",8
"These games usually get taken down quick, and games like these can be reported.
",3
"There can be inappropriate chats, but chats can be disabled in the settings.
",1
"The security of Roblox is not that great, but it shouldn't be a problem if your child isn't a successful developer on Roblox.
",5
"It is very easy to get hacked on Roblox, remind your child to stay off of 3rd party websites if someone in game tells you to go to a 3rd party website.
",4
"butt... the only problem is that things in the avatar shop that are super expensive like 1,000,000 robux.
",8
"People with create all different ways to curse they need more safety.
",1
"there is a lot of bullying and it can make people feel really bad about them selfs.
",2
"violence, there are so many games that include blood guns killing and more one game you jump off a cliff and start bleeding and try breaking all your bones and get a concussion.
",3
"Most games are very disappointing i wouldn't bother playing again.
",8
"Nice platform and so, but some games can be hijacked and spammed with bad stuff, and some games are violent.
",3
"Also the community is completely retarded.
",1
"Lots of toxic people and online daters.
",2
"Too much things you have to pay real money for.
",6
"Also lots of hackers.
",8
"Kids/Teens can say Hell, and may be offensive to some families.
",1
"Some games have 6/10 violence like piggy, it has blood and I wouldn't recommend that game for 10+ unless your chilld is mature and can handle it.
",3
"It starts to become a big thing in life to children and you should probably set a time limit with only on weekends before it becomes a big problem and they cannot handle it.
",7
"Messages - The messages are NOT great.
",1
"Most of the time they aren't detailed to the fact they are realistic.
",2
"If your a parent who dosent want blood or knives and guns you should block Piggy, Murder Mystery Two, Traitor and other games like that.
",3
"You can actually get banned from saying things like that.
",2
"Swearing - Swearing can happpen here and there on the platform People will say curse words by bypassing the chats filter.
",1
"The best way to deal with this is to turn off chat before they start playing.
",7
"Inappropriate games: If you want to avoid these you can just not play these games such as, Meepcity, Brookhaven, Bloxburg, etc.
",7
"Violence: Don't be an overprotective parent.
",4
"Jailbreak gets hate however, only young ones don't know well.
",2
"Scams: I saw someone call out Roblox for something not their fault.
",0
"They blame Roblox for those items being gone.
",6
"Cons: Easily avoidable inappropriate settings.
",2
"I don't think you should give this to a little kid because they don't know well enough and they will probably buy something without permission.
",7
"i like but it gets boring and you find weird thing so yah
",9
"•Yes, you can purchase Robux, if you don't like this 
",7
"   side of Roblox, just don't let your kids purchase 
",7
"   them.
",0
"THIS GAME IS SO DISCUSTING THERE IS SO MUCH SEXUALL STUFF AND THERE LITTERLY STUFF THAT CAN KILL PEOPLE LIKE GUNS KNIFES AND PLUS THERES HOROR GAMES JUST MAKE THESE GAMES AND STUFF GONE ITS HORIFFYING AND DISCUSTING JUST STOP THISS.
",0
"and now i only have 1.4 million.
",0
"But there are a few woes and bad stuff to it
",4
"
",0
"1.
",0
"Copy and pastes/slenders, aka online daters
",8
"These guys look ugly, normally wearing lots of hairs and  a stitchface.
",8
"They do really nasty stuff and make really awful games.
",2
"They were rude to me a lot so avoid copy and pastes.
",1
"Inappropriate games.
",0
"Games like ""Hugging Hangout"" or ""Copy and paste hangout"" etc involve heavy inappropriate actions.
",1
"I will not explain how DISGUSTING these games are but avoid them kiddos, teens and adults!
",7
"Predators
",0
"People will look for a partner but then it turns out to be a fat 70 year old man or whatever.
",0
"Please monitor your kid for this stuff so yeah.
",7
"Bad moderation
",2
"Unlike parent reviews, roblox has bad moderation.
",2
"You will say yes and get warned for it (happened to me) or upload BF and GF from friday night funkin and get warned but people who swear and do disgusting behavior do not get banned.
",0
"(Under 10 kids tend to be annoying and rude too, so check their chat.)
",7
"Though, there is a problem with inappropriate content on the site.
",1
"To fix this, you can make your child's account
",5
"there is some violence in the game like exploding towers and stuff but its nothing to graphic.
",1
"The website is made for mature peoples that don't click on randoms ads of violents games or guns games.
",9
"There is robux buy (wich you child can EASLY accses on the home page) that costs alot so if your child buys robux without your permission, say bye bye to 150 $$$.
",7
"Lots of online dating and abusive and hatful and other stuff.
",1
"For example, one time some one blamed all thier problems on me and another thretand to find my IP.
",5
"Honesly, not a great game.
",2
"Some of the games can be scary or inappropriate but you can simply report the game and they will remove it.
",3
"For those of you who think roblox is bad for your child you are completely wrong.
",7
"HACKERS ARE IN THIS GAME.
",0
"MY SISTER AND I GOT INTO A FIGHT ABOUT ROBLOX.
",0
"STUPID GAME NEVER EVER PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",0
"stupid parents and news channels think things never change cause they think its violence when its just a cartoon and think that hacking is a problem when its insanely rare now since the only hacks that people even use are speed and flying hacks so remember this is super rare to happen now in 2020-2021
",1
"Some cons though is automatic Roblox moderation bans, inappropriate content creators, swearing, and hacking.
",2
"If the chat is “tOxIC” then just turn it off from your settings.
",7
"Now it’s literally full of inappropriate content in the game not like the old Roblox, Old roblox is better people didn’t swear they don’t online date.
",1
"Now it’s just full of toxic people, Rule 34 which is the inappropriate things, Swearing and exploiting that ruins the game
",4
"There are users cursing or bypassing the filter chat every online game.
",1
"There are users that try to curse in the online chat but in most cases it is to no avail and it filters as hashtags.
",1
"Usually, filter chat works too well and sometimes whenever you are trying to say something normal it hashtags it out.
",1
"While there are violent games in Roblox it is nothing more than red puddles around blocks of your child’s avatar.
",1
"When your character dies, it falls apart, like a lego falling apart.
",3
"And the rumors that ROBLOX gets hacked often is completely untrue.
",1
"But there are some people on roblox who make inappropriate games and try to bypass filters.
",1
"If you're child is in elementary I would recommend you turn off the chat.
",7
"Overall, good game but a bad community.
",2
"I dont even know if you can call them outbreaks even though.
",4
"There is a few games you need to watch out for though, there are a few bad apples called ""Condo games"".
",1
"These are games to where you can do sexually explicit things with other players.
",3
"Only downside is that there are some games with a ton of pop-ups, and if you don’t what you are doing, you could accidentally purchase something.
",3
"I don't see anything disturbing, eye catching, or in appropriate about this game given the fact that I've been playing for a good 4-5 YEARS.
",6
"Such as blood and gore.
",3
"Parents: My strong advice to you: If you have a small child who plays Roblox, try to monitor what their activity is, and if it's disturbing... Get them off immediately.
",7
"It can by dangerous and theres a lot of bullys but you can easily block them.
",7
"However kids may want robux and get mean over it so be careful
",7
"I have indeed been called names or bullied on Roblox but it is the internet and the internet isnt always sunshine and rainbows and there is a feature where you can block people if they are being mean or annoying.
",7
"please be careful though, inform your child not to go onto nonroblox sites other players tell them to; there is many scambots.
",7
"and some people bypass the chat filter, but that isn't roblox's fault
",1
"And I stopped playing around a year ago.
",0
"Honestly I don't like this game and there are so many better ones out there.
",4
"For all the helicoptor parents, or the ones that only allow like 30 minutes or have screen time at all
",6
"Grow up and learn that your child too is a person.
",7
"You aren't helping no one by doing so.
",0
"Roblox is easily for ages 8 and up, but anything after 14 and honestly, people of that age start loosing interest, people outgrow things.
",3
"So no, your child isnt going to be requested of nude pictures anytime soon.
",8
"Also there is a censorship thing in game which annoys the crap out of everyone.
",1
"Some people complain certain roblox  games  being too voilent but those games weren't  intended for children to play and were aimed at the adults that play it.
",4
"Parents also say that the chat is too toxic but any social media platform that has a chat will be toxic like facebook and youtube.
",1
"There are scammers, which either post suspicious links in the chat, or invite random strangers to join a game in which you have to type in your password.
",7
"There are moderators who nearly instantly crack down and ban scam games and scammers, and other types of indiviuals breaking the roblox Terms Of Service (Sorta like rules.
",5
"now bad side.
",2
"Places to watch out for these creeps are hangouts.
",8
"( Bonus: There is a game called furry hunting simulator) Im suspecting Roblox didnt get rid of these ODERS because a lot of them spend money on Robux, the currency to make themselves look nice, and if course Roblox wants cash.
",2
"You cant earn robux for free, and that makes kids under five go to scam sites that well, scam YOU out of your money, or just your child's Roblox account if you got lucky.
",5
"Also lots of people bypass the chat filter using hacks.
",1
"THE PEOPLE ON ROBLOX RUINED EVERYTHING!!!
",0
"I will admit here, that ROBLOX does have a pretty toxic community, people use the word NOOB as an insult, so either click their username on the leaderboard to your top right and click the ''block'' button, so you don't have their messages.
",5
"ROBLOX does have some violent games but not always, the only games I recommend you do not show your kids until they are at least 10 or higher, are- Murder mystery 2- Piggy all chapters- Arsenal- DA hood- and games where you break out of jail.
",3
"Many other games besides these do not have blood, just a health bar, and your character falls apart and respawns if they die.
",3
"People like to sell addicting gamepasses that cost ROBUX, ROBUX cost real money.
",6
"Only buy them 400 if they beg and do what you need them to do.
",7
"Some games like arsenal and murder mystery have killing, and there is no blood in games, but if you don't want your kid playing these games, don't let them play it.
",3
"If you think a child will date someone, then tell them to only be in a ""family"" with their friends.
",7
"Robux costs money.
",6
"If you suddenly get charged money from roblox even though you didn't pay for it, your child probably bought it.
",7
"if you think people will make fun of your child and call them a noob, 1. tell your child to not care,2.
",7
"it is the internet, 3. if you think that getting called a noob will ruin your child's life, don't let them be on the internet.
",7
"You can report anything on roblox, and if someone is bullying, report and block.
",7
"Yes, there are oders and hackers, but you can report them.
",2
"I know there can be cons to Roblox like maybe an adult is joining a game and asking personal questions but a way to fix that is either don't answer, leave the game, report them, or if its getting too far turn off chat mode from your privacy settings.
",7
"Also swearing shouldn't be a problem because if Roblox thinks your typing something inappropriate it will give tags.
",5
"DUDE THIS SWEATY 3 YEAR OLD KILLED ME IN PIGGY BUT HE WAS HACKING LIKE BROOOOOOOO THEY SHOULD BAN HACKERS AND THEN IN JAILBREAK I WAS ROBBING A MEUSEOM AND THEN THIS WEIRD KID JUST WENT AND SHOT ME FOR NO RESON!!!!!!
",0
"DONT BUY IT PLZPLZPLZPLZPLZPLZ U JUST DIE AND THEN U RAGE AN D BRAK UR PC DONT BUY PLEASE DONT BUY THE GAME D:
",0
"I just find it somewhat annoying that you have to pay real money for a ton of stuff, for example, the Dominus Empyreus is more expensive than a freaking house!
",6
"Also, I feel like Roblox does need to work on their Safety and Privacy, as although they have two step verification, that doesn't work on things like XBox, allowing hackers to get into your account, I've already had one account banned for no reason, and another one hacked.
",6
"Look, I know that there are scammers out there, and there are hackers, but some of you parents are really STUPID!
",2
"I know I am only 16, but I saw some of your reviews and I thought they were REALLY dumb and stupid.
",0
"First, I want to tell you that 3/8 of the angry reviews out there are just kids angry that their Roblox account got banned from stealing their parent's credit card.
",7
"Third, the website does not hacked, in fact it has NEVER GOTTEN HACKED, you parents are just plain STUPID, Fourth, nobody gives a SHIT to know your credit card got hacked, it is just some stupid hacker, NOT ROBLOX!!!
",7
"Last, do not listen to those stupid parent reviews you can OBVIOUSLY tell if the review is fake.
",7
"The ONE thing about roblox that you should worry about is censorship.
",7
"Roblox has some of the worst censorship of any platform, but if your kid plays only well-developed games and games they trust, they should be fine
",3
"
",0
"oh yeah, and NEVER EVER join a game that has the title Sent_Cons or something along those lines.
",5
"You may experience some infuriating levels sometimes tho.
",2
"Then when I try to find new games, there is A LOT of games to choose and it is difficult for me to decide.
",8
"But beware, do not share your personal information to anyone as they can hack your account and the main problem in roblox is the microtransactions in games such as Adopt Me, Jailbreak, Mad city and so on.
",8
"People in roblox can make their character completely naked and some games have blood and gore and there are some scary games and in some games u can play in a bar
",3
"Some of these parents are just confused.
",2
"Roblox can't do refunds because you can't send them the money back and they can't take robux out of your account.
",6
"The inappropriate stuff is extremely rare now.
",1
"4 stars because some things cost lot of robux and you can not make t shirts or adds or groups for free and you need 1000 robux to  change usrename
",7
"It's for kids cuz you cant curse it will censor it fully there might be some s*x games but 1 day or 2 it will get deleted.
",1
"at first it seems like a decent game that allows you to socialize and learn new things, however, if you dig too deep, you can find all sorts of iffy things, such as overly violent or sexual games, people bypassing the filter and substance use.
",8
"you may also encounter, but the chances are low, scammers, dangerous people or predators.
",8
"I saw a game about demon pets that could fly, and another about evil peppa pig characters violently murdering players, it was horrible and this youtuber I think it's something like kre let's just call them Forrest so uh Forrest is evil making content based on these demon games I don't like it.
",0
"So for those who say it has no educational value, you'd be incorrect.
",4
"There's the obvious, getting people to give away their password, but do talk to your kids saying why they should not do this because many people will not hesitate to ask for your kids password.
",7
"There are bypassed swear words, but if you don't want your children seeing them, put their age as under 13, then, essentially all swear words will tag.
",7
"however there can be some creepy people as almost all online websited have.
",2
"If your a parent and say no to Robux, It will often lead to tears.
",5
"But why does my child want Robux so bad?
",7
"There is some violence in games like ''Murder mystery 2'' Where if you are innocent, You hide from the murderer, If your sheriff, You kill the murderer, But if you're the murderer, You either run around with a gun shooting people Or you get a knife where you stab people.
",3
"There is blood.
",2
"Piggy is not far from very scary, Where these Animals kill you with weapons if you don't escape.
",3
"All the parent who says there is swearing, I just heard a voice from hashtags say to the parents ''Am I a joke to you?''
",1
"Please do NOT online date.
",2
"there are a few bugs where it randomly freezes your camera, But those are pretty rare.
",3
"The only things I dont like about Roblox is Right now the games are a little bland so it gets a little boring at some points, and the amount of bots/scammers make sure your kid does not go to any of the fishy websites as they will steal your account.
",5
"And roblox has a huge tax fee for when you put items up for sale that cost robux it is 30%.
",5
"The thing is that there are ODERS (Online Daters) and they might try to get your kid to inappropriately role play with them.
",7
"But this isnt all the best it can be a bit non user friendly with the amount of in app purchases to do anything and 18+ games that slip past the roblox moderation.
",2
"Sometimes, that is dangerous.
",2
"there are some games that are for 18+ and some for 5+ 
",3
"here's an example of a 18+ game, it is called bloody battle and it contains more ""ketchup"" than needed and when you chop people's heads off you can see insides.
",0
"would not recommend this game for people under the age of 18.
",4
"The reason is alot of people online date in those games which is very dangerous.
",2
"Also in the game Roblox uses hashtags which puts hashtags for any bad words or sexual comments.
",1
"For example with curse like f---k they usually say stuff like 4ock or with b--ch they usually say biss.
",1
"Also in games they have some blood but thats only in games like ""Da hood"" Which is like a gangster game where you act like ur apart of a gang so you also want your kids to avoid that if they arent mature enough.
",3
"Just be aware of these things that I will mention here:
",4
"Scam games and websites DO exist, do not get fooled by so called ""Free Robux and/or Premium"", and use common sense, because somethings might look too good to be true, Roblox staff would NEVER ask you for your credentials, if you find something too good to be true, it most likely is, plus people make these scam games, for example: If you see a game on Roblox saying if you buy a game pass from that game you will get rare pets in Adopt Me, tell your kid i
",7
"There are scammers on the site (I mentioned that earlier) looking to steal your robux, limiteds or just your account altogether, locking you out of your account with a password change and a change to the connected email address, finally, we get to toxic individuals, who just want your attention and just generally ruin your day.
",5
"Keep in mind that there is a clear line between ""Trolling"" and ""Being Toxic"", so if you find your child being rude in-game for no reason whatsoever, they might just be toxic, and you should speak to your child about it.
",7
"I think that kids under the age 8 should not play roblox without supervision because they can be scammed very easily.
",3
"There are also scary games on roblox that might terrify your kids.
",7
"However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire with his sights now set on world domination.
",9
"Roblox is a bad game.
",2
"It often is just a gateway to losing your money and wasting it.
",6
"Their often is online bullying, hacking, racism, and rudeness.
",1
"DO NKT PLAY OR LET YOUR KIDS PLAY THIS!!
",0
"I know what you're thinking, ""OMG IT'S LIVE, IT'S BAD FOR KIDS!""
",7
"hello y'all so theres something parents should be understanding roblox has some inappropriate games there's some that says ""cuss ""or ""swear"" here but roblox blocks curse words.
",2
"ok next is ""violence"" so yea you pass by your child and hear gun noises or like knife sounds or instead of that screaming.
",3
"Yea you get worried and get mad at the  person/company for the harm but actually it's just an oof sound and all body parts fall on the ground but that's not violence yea knife and guns are REALLY bad for your child but guess what?
",3

"In my personal opinion roblox is a good game however if your child has a history of not following the rules this is not a good game for them there is lots of cussing but it is blanked out and also there are very innopropite games that children should not play if you are letting your child play this you should be careful about what they are doing has everything n some games are better than others in roblox also get' s player accounts get hacked sometimes

"And to avoid those games with players who somehow rape you like they say?

"The users are rude and constantly swearing.

"It has very inappropriate games for even teenagers, that do not get reported.

",7
"Another thing is friends can be toxic, online friend can be toxic because of drama that happens in game, this is mostly starts with roleplaying, if it gets to serious people can get their feelings hurt.
",2
"Another huge thing hacking and scamming, in games like adopt me scamming is huge, for example, let me paint a conversation between your child and a scammer, 
",3
"Scammer:""Trust trust trading people!""
",5
"Scammer: NO!
",0
"~Scammer leaves the game~

"Basically  a Trust trade is  when your child gives a scammer a valuable thing and expects it back after the trade goes through when it does the scammer leaves with their pet.

"There's also the Bun Bun girls, a group of hackers who join scammers servers and alert players the Bun Bun girls will not hack your child don't worry, one time I was playin adopt me and I was lookin through the server list and I saw a Bun Bun girl, she looked through the server and didn't find any scammers then she just left.

"of corse be careful there are rude ppl.
",2
"unlikely to run into ppl like that tho and the chat has high filitered honestly the chat filter sucks ngl

"So there are some people who think they “online date” in the game but if you read the rules, it is a rule in the tos that you CANNOT date or you will get banned.

"Gore is never allowed.

"So check if your kids have been playing blood games and if you want just tell him to read because you can’t block or delete those games.

"And don’t worry about your kids swearing.

"It always gets censored unless if you turn off safe chat.

"Turning it off lets your kid swear.
",7
"Sure, some violence might have guns, blood, body parts lost, and injuries, but some games can teach you the lessons of teamwork, technology, and critical thinking, the swearing can be a little to much, but like there are tags or ""#"" to block it, but people can say like ""hell"", ""damn"", numbers like the code is ""821023"", and insults like your bad at the game"" or ""leave u stupid noob"".

"Here I will list reasons to play the game and some of its problems.
",6
"This isn’t a HUGE problem as long as your using common sense but make sure you don’t fall for anything “free robux”
",7
"
",0
"2.
",0
"Scammers.
",0
"People can scam your limiteds and in-game items, so be careful and use logic.
",5
"There isn’t a huge problem other than it being so stupid, because with the tags system the pedos can’t say anything.
",1
"Moderation on Roblox isn’t amazing.
",6
"You can get banned for RIDICULOUS reasons, such as uploading an image that says “yes”, or owning a “pois item” (a limited that was stolen).
",9
"Almost every single top clothing item is bottled and copied so make sure to use clothes from well-known Robloxians so you don’t support stolen and botted clothing.
",9
"—————————————————————————————————-
",0
"That was the list of PROBLEMS on Roblox.
",0
"Though it has swearing, and not good stuff for children...
",2
"I would say it's a bit annoying that roblox has TOO many tags, even more than instagram ;-; 
",6
"It's still fun and has a lot of different genres and stuff!
",3
"As I have been reading through the reviews, it has come to my attention that quite a few parents are being over-reactive about how either sexual, or just not good in general games are.
",2
"If they say Big A**, it just makes it tagged out so sometimes people say big a only but that's not very much.
",2
"Sometimes they can bypass it by saying the bad word ""d*** and make it say dam.
",1
"But that's not enough.
",7
"But a problem with roblox is that you can easily get hacked!
",1
"You lose all your data when the hacker changes the password.
",6
"Roblox should have a more secure system when it comes to pressing the forgot password button.
",9
"This is a game where you just bully each other.
",8
"Too many hackers.
",1
"I agree it should be 13+ because there is words that are bad and ROBLOX don't cut the words out.
",1
"Take Arsenal for example, you just shoot each other and hackers, also bullies and toxic people.
",3
"Very bad, don't play
",7
"There are Pedos and Stuff on roblox...
",8
"Alright, I've been seen reviews about this game, and i'm pretty sure these problems with kids playing this are kinda stupid.
",2
"Some of the games in this platform are kinda... not appropiate or possibly can make your child waste a lot of money.
",8
"So, here's the list of the games I don't recommend.
",8
"Now, ""what's so bad with trading?
",1
"Children don't understand that you can easily get scammed.
",7
"Many people have gotten scammed over this game, and Youtube is filled with tutorials on how to scam (which, if you didnt know, scamming is a crime).
",6
"Same reasons as Meepcity, the fandom is innapropiate for kids.
",8
"Now, some of these obbies have checkpoint platforms but with random items you can buy, which are expensive and just try to spend all of your money on, and you can easily just get scammed.
",2
"And you should play some (like difficulty charts), but the fact that Roblox barely does something about this is horrible.
",3
"(It has been on the news so many times, and parents still can't get better protection?
",2
"Just let children that are very young not play as much.
",4
"Because you can possibly either make them like the Meepcity fandom people, or just lose all of your life on a singular game because of random purchases that weren't made by you.
",8
"Or getting scammed because your child can't understand that there's bad people online.
",7
"so yes there is iffy content if your looking for it like condo games but is really hard to find  and some are you are afraid to about satan and the game but there is no blood language is censored so is politics also if you are worried put restrictions on
",1
"Roblox is a strange topic for many reasons, First off yes this game is meant for kids.
",2
"speaking on the topic of messages, players can send messages to other people However the chatting system is super strict and you cannot send numbers, swear words, and anything else you don’t want your kid to see.
",1
"On the topic of safety, Roblox is very trustworthy but some of the games are not, you can usually tell this when a game asks for you to enter a username or password, do not enter it!
",5
"They will use the password and overtake your account that you won’t be able to get back.
",9
"There are some online daters but they can’t say anything as Roblox chat system blocks them.
",1
"Kids, this is where you stop reading!
",7
"and These games are not meant for kids and are not allowed on Roblox but sometimes it slips through the cracks.
",1
"Oders consists of other players doing inappropriate dances and movements.
",8
"These games are nearly impossible to stumble across and they usually get deleted in about an hour or less.
",3
"so this game may have mean people but there are bullies in every game so yeah.
",2
"if you see a oder you dont need to accept them you just need to kill them using a gun theres lot of oders you dont need to ban them
",7
"First of the app is rated 12+ but that doesn't really support anything.
",3
"And yes there is some iffy content but that's only if you play one of the games like that.
",3
"UNLESS you play game inside it like DEAD SILENCE or any other games that may have violence in it.
",3
"But not all games hat have violence inside it are very gory and bloody.
",8
"There are just knives and guns
",3
"
",0
"if u have a child in my personal opion i started playing when i was seven and i played games with little or lots of blood inside it.
",0
"There is not any SWEAR WORDS that can be typed in the chat... UNLWSS people bypass it.
",1
"Very bad, 9 year olds are toxic and dumb as hell and half of the people that play roblox games are garbage at them.
",4
"The community is so toxic.
",2
"The banning system is ridiculous, you can get banned for saying ""L"".
",1
"The games are boring and not entertaining and competitive at all.
",4
"Those kids sound like as if they have drugs in their room.
",1
"when there arms and head and everything fall off
",0
"Although its a fun game, like other games, there people that spam, scam and do online dating while playing.
",8
"Before you let your children play this game, please teach your children about safety and privacy before playing Roblox.
",7
"it doesnt make kids dumber or smarter unless they play games sin roblox with no physics, I advise you to only let the child play when you are watching OR let him play and check the game once every day and check what he played, and if he/she played a sex game or games with violence then its not roblox's fault, its yours and the owner of the game, Roblox doesnt make the games but tries to make roblox safer for kids and sex games are only accessed when the user searches a specific word
",3
"Somewhat bad words are used without bypassing, but the worst it gets there is ""Hell"".
",1
"Yes some people use stuff like 64ck as the F word but you can easily report them.
",1
"There are always bad sides though, like ODer [online dater] games.
",1
"It's good for kids but warning there are some bad games like jailbreak hi kreekcraft
",9
"Some robloxians (People Who Play Roblox) are very toxic, and a very mean, but don't worry, only a few people are like that!
",7
"some games are not good.
",3
"If you don’t want your kid to spend money on robux, don’t let them.
",7
"some such as people bypassing the roblox censor to curse, bypassing moderation games with bad things (sex, nudity , cursing, etc), clothing items that may be offensive or too reveling, creating gore in the games, etc.
",1
"Don't let that be a reason to not play it as the moderation is quick on stuff like that.
",2
"Roblox has some other problems that might not make you play it and this is a list of the one i've found over the 5 yearsof me playing the game.
",7
"Dating: one problem of roblox is the Online Daters or as The Roblox Community and or ROBLOXians call them ODers these this problem was started in 2012 when avatars got better and has spiked since 2017  this is where a player pretends to be dating another player and most of the time has fake in game sex in some shape or form most of the roblox games have tried to fix this problem by getting rid of some features and if they mix with the trend problem it could get really bad.
",0
"Trends: yes there are some good trends, but there has been a lot of bad ones of recent (soft, slenders, copy cat, goblin, etc)  most of the time these trends are for Girlfriends and boyfriends an example is slenders and copy cats copy cats normal date slenders.
",1
"slenders are tall edgy looking boys and copy cats copy other people with short edgy looking girls.
",1
"this and online dating mixed could be bad.
",2
"Dating +  Trends: This is a very bad combination that could cause your child to do bad things.
",3
"most of the time the people who mix these problems get very attached and will play sex simulation games where you have sex with other players
",5
"
",0
"Bullies: most players who spend money on the game will call others who have the free items ""noob"",""Bacon hair"",""Noodle Hair"", and ""Beanie Brain"" depending on how they look and these users have all the cool and new items most of the time.
",6
"adopt  me is a little trap meant to grab money out of your pockets avoid adopt if you want to spend only a little on roblox.
",7
"and that was the list of bad things that roblox has that won't go away.
",8
"The game is mostly pg but of course kids or teens might find a way to say inappropriate things.
",3
"There are inappropriate games but they get taken down pretty quick.
",2
"The main problem is parents decide to ignore the app details that says 12 and up.
",3
"But don’t complain about an app that has an already set age demographic.
",7
"Most zombie apocalypse and prison games (literally cops and robbers online)incorporate shooters.
",1
"Are bullies
",9
"                 .
",0
"Are scammers
",8
"                    .And also bots which scam your child for free robux.
",5
"Also, without a healthy gaming attitude, one can become ADDICTED to roblox ( like i am right now- trying to change)   and it can severely affect their  grades.
",5
"BULLIES!
",0
"THEY CALLED MY SON A n00b!THEY SWEAR , AND INSULT OTHERS!
",0
"You cant talk, and you cant even see chats.
",7
"MY SON IS PLAYING BAD GAMES!
",0
"ROBLOX IS VERY BAD!
",0
"THERE IS LOTS OF BLOOD AND SEX!
",0
"ROBLOX IS SO TRASH!
",0
"Discipline him, and if it's the friend's fault, unfriend and block said player.
",5
"Horror games and zombie games (not all) have blood in them.
",3
"What's the point of the horror if not?
",3
"If you don't like it, horror games say in the desc that ""If you have negative responses tho these types of games, don't play them!""
",3
"3- *epicly slaps* YOU NEVER TOLD ME HOW TO DEAL WITH PLAYERS!
",0
"You could report the player for bullying ( although ,in fighting games, toxic players are always present and the might keep bullying your child.
",1
"If it's too much, go to another server.
",7
"Report games which are bad.
",8
"It's disgusting when i try to play roblox, and i stumble on some scented con (that's what all those games are called).
",3
"I'm tired.
",0
"So, don't hate them.
",2
"THERE'S TOO MUCH!
",0
"THIS IS WHY ITS HARD TO ROLEPLAY IN ANIME BATTLE SIMULATOR!
",0
"They censor almost everything.
",1
"The mobile app has some issues right now so for now if you have one let your kids play on the laptop.
",6
"Scamming has gotten worse with Scambots (nonexistent players (bots) telling you to go a site) there is another issue with the chat filter and the clothing.
",1
"The chat can get easily bypassed causing your child to see inappropriate words and clothing issues including using Self Harm as a “clothing trend”.
",1
"A lot of children play bypassed audios which is basically kind of Roblox’s fault for accepting these types of audios which is a bad business move, also like the chat, this can cause your children to hear inappropriate words to the point of the n word.
",3
"This is just many of the things I’ve seen and with all this I recommend you keep an eye on your children while they are playing Roblox.
",5
"Only problem is the amount of things that get bypassed, such as 18+ content (rare) and swearing either in chat or with audio.
",1
"some events in roblox can be violent like ""Bloodfest"" and people swear.
",1
"Roblox is a place where if you look hard enough you can find many issues with it.
",7
"The Main issue is that Roblox is really only a creative platform for the creators of the games to use to make their game, so blaming ROBLOX for inappropriate servers is like blaming a camera company for someone taking inappropriate photos.
",7
"Ultimately a review of this site should be focused much less about the content of the game as your child can choose what they do or do not want to play at any time.
",7
"Moderation is hyper-sensitive and many words which are safe are censored using hashtags and this usually blocks out any inappropriate content that your child will see.
",1
"If you have heard of ""loopholes"" where content that is inappropriate can be said then this is obviously a problems but not one something that is unique to Roblox this is a human universal.
",3
"A lot of rules will have loopholes and people will exploit these no matter if we are talking Roblox, Gaming, Society.
",1
"With concern to inappropriate games, it is not Roblox's intention that these games exist only a natural biproduct of kids being devious and trying to feel rebellious.
",3
"If your kid is frequenting these servers ultimately it is up to you as a parent to drag them off such games or explain to them prior the danger such a game possesses.
",7
"It is of course not going to be perfect but it's issues are common and unfortunate but not ultimately something you will be able to prevent on the internet.
",2
"So if you believe your child to be mature and responsible to any decent standard it should be no problem for them to play Roblox.
",7
"roblox isn't a bad game, it's just the kids who think they can get away with blasting 200 decibel rap songs that have 10+ swears in them.
",8
"Do not get this game!
",6
"Once I was playing Corridor of Hell and this girl came in and starting spamming the chat.
",0
"I told her to stop and another girl said that they were cousins and I had to ignore her.
",0
"She is way too young to play Roblox.
",4
"Roblox is not for little kids.
",2
"Also, I was reading this review on what parents should know about Roblox a couple months back and there was this footnote that said a 6 year old was playing and she was invited to a sex room.
",0
"People with Robux actually bully people about being poor.
",9
"I remember my sister was playing Daycare and this girl, not saying the username, called her poor because my sister did not have Robux.
",0
"Also, if you are through with being bullied because you have no Robux, most people would use a Robux Generator.
",7
"These generators do not work.
",7
"People put viruses in the generator so they can get your info.
",3
"Hackers can also hack your account.
",5
"There are rumors that the most famous Roblox hacker, not exposing the username (again), is coming back.
",5
"Younger kids can easily accept fake trades.
",7
"If someone says that to you, they will not give you Robux, even if they promise you.
",5
"Eventually, that person got hacked.
",0
"Swear words or offensive words are tagged out and Roblox also has the ability to tag out full sentences if they are rude.
",1
"If someone is being mean or offensive (which is hard because of the tags) you can report them and Roblox will review the chat and see what happened and either ban them or, in extreme cases, delete their account.
",7
"Roblox's main rule is ""Roblox is not a place for online daters"" and if found out will be banned.
",1
"The game through my first 1 month
",6
"I saw 50 people dating
",0
"10 adults
",4
"And 20 people trying to be sexual with me
",0
"Roblox also trys to milk you of your money
",8
"
",0
"Thats the cons
",6
"
",0
"Heres the pros
",4
"
",0
"Teaches coding
",2
"Fun with family
",0
"Its only ok if you turn of basically every single chat feature
",7
"Bur even that is bad
",1
"Because i went to a game,
",0
"And i saw madness
",6
"Hackers made sex models and could use it on players the most nudity
",1
"And swears ever.
",1
"Alsooo
",0
"If you dont believe me
",5
"Just go to the videos most are ok
",9
"But some have to be completely blurred
",1
"And just search roblox oder
",7
"There are so many online daters,
",8
"So if you want ur kids dating a 20 yearold,
",7
"Seeing nudity
",1
"Swearing
",0
"And lose all your money dont listen to me and let them have chat.
",6
"I know that there are some ""innapropiate"" games, but he doesnt even know about them.
",3
"(just gotta get around scripting though) Any people saying certain games are non-child friendly listen.
",1
"The only slight issue is that there are free robux scams/adopt me scams and roblox is a bit too family friendly.
",5
"The scams I know roblox can't fix but the family friendly stuff they can.
",6
"Other than that, the only thing a kid would have to worry about is fantasy violence.
",6
"Some games do get taken down for curtain reasons, like not kid friendly or copyright reasons.
",6
"Sure Roblox does have a censor robot, but its pretty much trash, some words can be abreviated into ways that the robots dont detect, and numbers and some random words that are not even bad get blurred out from hashtags (#), for example try saying 12, it might just come out as ##.
",1
"If you happen to encounter something inappropriate, then you probably used the search bar and clicked on it or was clickbaited.
",7
"The one problem really is how the community acts.
",2
"According to the player, if you don't have an Avatar that has clothes which cost a lot of Robux, you are considered a ""noob"" and may end up being bullied in game.
",6
"Remove the horrible moderation (It's not that it falsely bans people-it barely ever unbans somebody) My advice is-buy a few Robux (enough to buy power-ups in game+ a good avatar), and make sure the game is OK. Face it, if you're not going to let your kid touch something if there's a little risk, how will it be when he/she faces a huge crisis?
",7
"Some Roblox developers really put pressure to buy Robux, just avoid those types of games.
",6
"If they aren't, why did you let them play this in the first place?
",7
"DONT PLAY JAILBERAK DONT ITS CONTAINS A LOT OF GUNS AND VOLCNCE.ALSO NO MAD CYIT ITS THE SAME.
",0
"Although there is some inappropriate games on roblox...
",2
"And about swears, yes the tagging system is pretty bad and your kid probably can't say numbers.
",2
"Just set a time limit, make sure they don't have your credit card to buy robux, monitor to make sure they don't play violent games.
",7
"What I mean is there's some games like, piggy that include dying.
",3
"I Don't Know Why Adults Call It Violence Game.
",0
"I Giving It 4 Star Because There's Many Online Dating, exploiters, Roblox Predators, Scams, Club Iris ( I Don't Know Why Roblox Still Not Banned That Game Yet) And More.
",0
"When I first saw this website I read the ROBLOX reviews from parents and HONESTLY, I think the parents are right and wrong, like they are saying that some games have BLOOD, not any game that I know has BLOOD in it, plus I've been playing ROBLOX for like 2-3 years now.
",2
"There are scammers on Roblox though, which try to steal peoples accounts and take all the Robux off it.
",5
"Some scammers may ask for your password for ""free Robux"" then they run off with your account and you never get any Robux.
",5
"If a user violates the terms of service, there account may either be warned, a 1 day ban, 2 day ban, week ban, 2 week ban, account deletion, Poison ban, IP ban, and the worst ban of them all, Invalid credentials ban.
",0
"Google them up if you don't understand.
",7
"It isnt perfect however.
",2
"Sometimes there are bypasses for inappropriate words that can annoy people and sometimes theres just too many bots.
",1
"my 17 year old brother played this he like a game called ""da streets"" which is demonic and satanic and bad.
",0
"he goot a currency celled ""robucks"" and made his character edgy and was wearing weird ""trash gang"" stuff.
",5
"my brother died in a car crash because of roblox because it demonic.
",0
"It hashtags all swear words and most numbers.
",1
"I don't understand why so may parents don't allow their children to play this game.
",4
"sometimes, bots come into a game and tell players to go to off site websites and ""get free Robux"" (Robux is the digital currency of Roblox that is used to buy items for your avatar and more)  all of the time, these site do not work and steal your Roblox account, these sites must be avoided at all costs.
",5
"The moderates work hard to stop these  scams but sometimes the scams can get through but most of the time, they are deleted in half an hour or so.
",8
"the games on Roblox are fun but some more violent games should be not aloud to play for younger kids.
",4
"It is good but my brother became toxic and started screaming when playing MM2 it is a toxic game you should not play it I recommend play Roblox islands a building games full of fun and you can create things in your style and become creative and also adopt me is fun it teen kids how it would be like to be a parent how they can be a good one when they grow up
",3
"ROBLOX is perceived as ""Bad"" with ""Harmful games"" or ""bad chatting messages"" but as a parent, it is your responsibility to look after your kids.
",6
"Ofcourse ROBLOX has it's fare share of problems but you cant blame them for all.
",9
"For example; scams.
",0
"hackers do hack accounts and go onto games and chat and you cant blame ROBLOX for this as they work hard as to # all the hacked websites out.
",5
"i dont understand why you think piggy is a bad game, its just a game.
",4
"However, there are scammers who claim they will give you money.
",4
"Some people try to swear, but most of it is blocked by the roblox chat filter.
",1
"More things are blocked when the user's account age is set to anything under 13.
",5
"Roblox is a good game, but there's problems, there's some violence on using weapon and other that younger kid can get scammed easily.
",2
"and also why tagging numbers, there's nothing inappropriate about numbers.
",4
"If you don't your kids to be scammed in Robux games and trading games please educate your child how to be safe.
",7
"And for trading please educate your child about scams.
",7
"Also, they get taken down quick.
",9
"If you're concerned about games like, Piggy or something because of the jumpscares, just know that they don't represent all games.
",1
"**I didn't talk about Robux problems because I don't have**
",7
"When I was playing adopt me someone said “f*ck you” (without the star and not to me I just saw it in the chat.)
",0
"also in adopt me I encountered someone being racist to black people... and I know that there are some inappropriate games on there.
",3
"10+ Also my friend got hacked so I have some safety and privacy concerns.....
",0
"I only think roblox should be 13 plus because there are many stupid 10 year old kids that don't know anything that come up to me and start arguing with me for no reason.
",4
"I once played a game with shooting and all it did was just disassemble your limbs.
",0
"Also, there are games that don't have anything like that.
",3
"The other only thing that can kill you in those games are lasers.
",3
"If your kid is playing something that is inappropriate, then tell them to play something else.
",7
"Roblox can't change what people play.
",5
"But then if you fail to go in stealthily it becomes a 1st person shooter game where you kill thousands of innocent people per round with semi realistic spurts of blood.Anyway sorry for the long review such a big game has lots to talk about.Hence below I will put a list of games that I like to play on Roblox their star rating and age rating.
",4
"Hyper realistic blood and wounds and some iffy concepts.
",4
"Although, sometimes its security is... questionable, a hacker can never see your name.
",5
"A platform that many parents get confused on.
",6
"The main thing is sexual content and innapropriate games.
",1
"So parents, the thing is if your child is playing games they should not be, don't blame it on ROBLOX, Blame it on them.
",7
"Why, you may ask, It's because on ROBLOX your child decides what they play, So if they're playing something innapropriate you know who did it wrong.
",7
"And you also might be wondering if ROBLOX says they are a child-freindly game, why are there innapropriate games?
",5
"And if a game is too innapropriate for ROBLOX the moderaters will take it down.
",4
"I have spent 1000s of dollars on it over the past 2 years and I wish there were better chat filters.
",6
"Because when u say “one” it looks like this ### so ya also there’s this game called shower simulator it’s funny but defiantly there are gross people on it and bad guys so teach ur child to stay away from these people but other than that it’s  very safe also I hear stories of kids getting photos and stuff but I don’t understand that because u can’t send links photos or images at all!
",8
"And I don’t know off a cheating game that’s not social media that lets u send photos or images so ya!
",8
"Idk why you would leave a bad review.....
",7
"This is something the parent should judge.
",7
"But there is so may hackers, computer virus, and you don't even now how is on the other side of the screen.
",1
"If you are the kind of person who says there is a very small chance me getting hacked.
",2
"Well let me just say be careful because one of my close friends actually got hacked!
",0
"Ok move on from that there is guns, dating, swearing, people smoking, and you don't now what people do in these games.
",3
"You may think that most games on roblox are hot garbage, Adopt Me, Brookhaven, Tower of Hell, Mega Fun Obby 99999 stages + escape through minion flamingo for infinite robux slide down 99999999 miles don’t seem very good (well unless you like to roleplay, “I don’t like it”) but there are at least a hundred gems down there for everyone, I won’t go into detail on any due to others’ tastes but I go to Juke’s Towers of Hell for obbies, Horrific Housing for randomness, Restaurant Tycoon 2 for tycoons and building
",6
"The only problems are the several free robux scams and scam bots that post links in the chat until they quickly get banned or tagged (this also covers swearing and sadly numbers) which leads me onto my only other major problem.
",5
"Only very young, gullible children can fall for the robux scams though and they likely won’t lose anything of importance, just tell them to not play Adopt Me and they will be fine (Adopt Me has overpriced gamepasses and pets that can easily get scammed from the very young and gullible playerbase of the game).
",3
"The only thing bad about it is that the moderation is not the best, but it's fine for Roblox.
",2
"Roblox has lots of games on it and every game has a different violence level some games that are suitable for young children are jailbreak, adopt me, royal high, and SharkBite also pretty much all of the simulators are good for kids but I personally do not like them I recommend you to play this
",3
"Adopt me- Dont believe everyhting good-- It could be a scam.
",5
"The only reason I rated it four stars-- aside from the games-- is that if someone tries to swear or talk inapropriately, and someone reports them, Roblox doesn't look into it that well.
",1
"So, if someone is swearing, I would suggest blocking them or leaving the game after reporting.
",7
"You cannot type numbers into the chat without them getting censored (using hashtags) so kids can't type personal information.
",1
"I could go on for hours about the chat filter, but more things it does is censors curse words, and also typos so you can't bypass words.
",1
"There are millions upon millions of games to choose from, some being extremely inappropriate.
",8
"I will point out that these are beyond Roblox's problem, and that you have to search these games up to find them.
",4
"If your kid has been in these games, it is most likely their problem.
",7
"These games are often called ""condos"" with sex and drugs in them.
",1

"Tip #3 NEVER and I say NEVER click on Free robux scams, read the link before you click on it.
",5
"Worried if your child is going to spend money on their account without permission?
",7
"I think it is a very fun game but it does have multiple problems.
",3
"It is very easy to bypass the sensors with x’s,  numbers, and symbole (like a$$) and you can wear bad words on clothes.
",1
"Most bad words and numbers are censored, sometimes people can get past that though, but it doesn’t happen often.
",1
"And robux is kind of expensive.
",6
"The game can be a little violent but that’s optional, a couple of games in Roblox I DO NOT recommend for 8 and under, are: Mortem Metallum and phantom forces.
",3
"I have read most of the parents reviews about ROBLOX and the community, but most of the things that parents are saying about ROBLOX and the community is a lot of fabricated information.
",2
"First of all, there has been a lot of scamming in ROBLOX.
",2
"Most of the time, scammers scam kids for their items in a game and they will not give the kids anything or they'll just give an inadequate item they didn't even ask for.
",7
"If you try to swear at somebody because they're annoying you, it will be censored.
",1
"But sometimes you could say ""N****"" or ""F u"" and it could possibly go in the chat.
",1
"Like I said, the parents reviews are mostly fabricated information.
",8
"For example, a parent said that they turned on Parental controls for their child so they cant play bad games.
",7
"Plus, some other parents are saying that ROBLOX is even way dangerous than Call of Duty (COD) or Red Dead Redemption.
",2
"Ok, before you click of of this review because I am just a teen with no sense of what it is like to be a parent, hear me out.
",2
"(Also please excuse my bad spelling and grammar in the review)
",0
"
",0
"(1) The CommonSense Media Parental Guide: The CommonSense Media Parental Guide is EXTREMELY outdated, and I want you to put this in your mind before reading it.
",7
"They no longer exist, and you do not need to worry about them and their dangers.
",7
"Also, the guide says a lot of incorrect things, but the one that spiked my attention the most is when it said how poorly ROBLOX moderated ODers, now if you don't know what an ODer is, ODer = Online Dater.
",0
"Builders Club also does not exist!
",1
"It is NOT availible on any mobile or XBox devices.
",4
"Which you can use to...scam people?
",7
"Ok, YES Adopt Me is full of scammers and that's why I rated it so highly but as long as your child is properly educated on scams (teaching moment for parents) they will be fine!
",7
"Why isn't this rated for a more mature audience!?""
",3
"And that is because of two words: Kill Effects, yes the game uses guns and before you start thinking of all those stories you hear of Serial Killers who played FPS games as a kid and turned phycho, yeah, that's a bunch of bullcrap.
",3
"This game is not bloody or violent is anyway, except for the guns and knives you use to take out your enemies.
",3
"And it is not bloody, there are different cartoony ""kill effects"" like one where you're enemy will fall down a trapdoor when you kill them or get hit by lightning.
",3
"You're freaking dumb!""
",6
"If you think about it the game is an opportinuty to teach kids about violence in real life and how serious it is and how you shouldn't do it.
",2
"(5) Parental Controls on ROBLOX and ODers/Condo Games, now the CommonSense Media guide and many others say ROBLOX has no parental controls and a kid could be exposed to anything bad.
",4
"Well, that is not true and over the past few years ROBLOX has extremely upgraded it's moderation system, innapropriate games get banned within literal minutes, and they added things for parents to use, such as the SafeChat feature, it applies to all users that make thier account age as 13 or under,  it means you cannot say numbers, and their is a feature where if you say the same thing too many times it will censor it because it may be a possible attempt at cursing.
",1
"And for ODers, yeah thanks to ROBLOX the average ODer account gets banned within a week, and the average condo game gets banned in 15 minutes- an hour so don't worry about those things.
",2
"You can just report them, block them, and leave the game and you don't need to worry about them again.
",7
"Almost everytime in these situations the culprit is the parents for leaving their credit card info in the child's device, which I don't know why they would do but they did.
",4
"So if this happens, don't blame ROBLOX look closely and see what mistakes you made.
",5
"It ruined her.
",9
"My brother is now an addict.
",0
"Oof.
",0
"But the setbacks from my perspective is there are hackers, and some ""online daters.""
",6
"If there are any hackers going around around roblox, try your best to avoid the games being hacked or don't play for the matter of time.
",8
"That is Roblox's way of tagging out swearing.
",4
"And in some killing games when someone dies the character falls apart.
",3
"First of all there are no  hackers  or people that can  hack your account 
",8
"yes if your kid is not mature  or really young then well he can tell people his password but  just block the chat unless you do not understand the internet its simple, but most  people who ""hack"" are just some dumb 9 year old kids and people who just want to get attention and who want to scare people.
",7
"Second of all  yes some games are ""violent"" but Roblox also dose not bring  6 and 9 year old kids  into their games they know that so they make other games that  13  and 14 year old's like me want to play like Arsenal Blood and Iron  Phantom Forces Murder mystery and if you do not like this games DO NOT LET  YOUR KIDS PLAY THEM  it's as simple as that  they don't have  gore and don't blame Roblox.
",3
"Third of all yes their is marketing and robux to buy things but how do expect Roblox to make money of their game which is FREE.
",6
"Fourth yes their are people that are mean but the chat filter dose TO much of a great job you cant even say numbers  yeah people find a way to bypass it but its the internet you big boomers people were mean as far back as the internet started and if kids are being mean to you ignore report leave game those are all options.
",1
"More 'violent' games don't even have blood.Sometimes bots enter a server you are in and promote scam websites for the in game money but you can reprort them or just leave the server.You can chat with other players and when you say numbers it tags* them (* this is wat i mean by tag : # )  sometimes it gets annoying cuz it was made so you cant give phone numbers away and when i want to say a number for a roleplay it tags it.
",1
"MODERATION/SAFETY:
",0
"Roblox has a very strict chat filter, but kids can still see swearing on the site and get into trouble.
",1
"You can report people who are doing inappropriate things in games but they often face no consequences as the Roblox moderation bot receives many, many reports.
",1
"There are lots of games with cartoon violence where you throw knives, shoot people (some first person shooters), but I very rarely encounter a game with blood or gore.
",3
"The characters usually just fall to the ground.
",3
"If someone is swearing in a Roblox game, your child can use /mute (username) to stop seeing their chat ingame.
",7
"Roblox can be a very fun or very harmful platform depending on how it is used.
",2
"If your kid’s 3 and is playing Roblox Murder mysteries, that’s not roblox’s fault.
",7
"That game belongs to who made it and you should ask for it to come down if your angry one 3 year old played a game with a bunch of older teens.
",5
"There is a chat filter but some people can still get past with saying inappropriate things but it’s very unlikely and difficult getting past the chat filter and its restrictions.
",1
"Roblox has hackers but it is not very common to see them - although there have been issues with people hacking accounts and hacking the Website/Game.
",8
"All you have to do to get rid of these people is report and block.

"is commen sence midea CEAZY

"roblox is so sos so safe for example i tried to tell my friend tht my phone broke and it blanked it same with numbers
",6
"Some specific games with hackers I remember are Beach house role play and Top roblox runway model, the worse one Beach house is not playable anymore so no worries it is much safer now, be aware of the 10-12 who think swearing is cool or being super tall/having fat legs looks good :/ tell your kids to not become one of them ok, and teach them to not give out information, ever, I'm saying because some parents apparently dont think about doing the obvious.
",5
"The users can be downright the most annoying, toxic, and pretentious losers that you can find online.
",5
"Get ready for the child to be harassed and called names... just because they wore a hat.
",4
"Another part of the community is extremely hateful.
",2
"Those people will be extremely vocal about how your child should kill themselves, about how they're degenerate and immoral.
",4
"This community is also the definition of a ""vocal minority"", and can ruin ROBLOX's reputation for the week that the news wants something to talk about, among... other communities.

"Dont listen to the Karens

"I have had it for a very long time of my childhood and only once have i hated it (i will get onto that later).
",0
"Some people can be a bit inappropriate but you will find that it is very rareto find it.
",4
"On games like tycoons they can give you weapons so you can kill other players, one time i was playing a not very popular one, and a person under the username btx_laxra did NOT like me.
",3
"They wouldnt leave me alone and kept blowing me up, however, to prevent these things happening, you can block users so you wont be in the same servers.
",7
"Some people make scam games (the reason i once almost hated roblox) they will ask for you pasword, claiming to give you things too good to be true like robux for free.
",5
"Also, bots can join games so that they can advertise fake free robux websites, but you can tell your children its a scam.Also, you can create your own avatar and some users make huge legs, their known as oders (online daters).

"I’ve played for 3+ years now and I’ve never seen any bloody games.

"All bad words are censored by Roblox admin.

"Too much inappropriate content, mostly from kids who don't even know what they're talking about, Once I found a WHOLE server talking about how bad gay people are.

"Just today I had to report two inappropriate usernames.

"It does try to filter out swearing, but people just find other ways to write it.

"It's a good game but if your kid gets bullied block the person who's bullying them

"People hack, do whatever on the internet.
",5
"Every online game will have at least one hacker trying to disturb other players.
",7
"ROBLOX can not do anything about it other than ban them.
",6
"So, moral of this review  ROBLOX isnt bad itself its the hackers that make it bad.
",6
"This game is really bad for kids 17 and under.
",6
"my friend plays roblox and i was watching and it also costs a lot of money so dont even bother with this bad game also its also really laggy and slow and once someone put my name on roblox and it didnt  even blur it out so DO NOT PLAY PLEASE.
",0
"Roblox has a lot of inappropriate people.
",2
"If not they can fall victim to predators.
",9
"There might be some online dating, cursing, and a little bit of violence.
",2
"(none of which is realistic.)
",2
"They are not true.
",3
"While there may be some games out there that contain some content that may be inappropriate for your child, most of the games on ROBLOX are not that bad.
",3
"Most FPS games my not be harmful, but games like Phantom Forces contain blood.
",3
"And there you go.
",3
"But to get a house you either have to buy one with the in-game currency or with robux because the starter house is very small and you just don't have the same creative freedom.

"the owner also said that if someone made them uncomfortable they could have them be locked out but also said 'if they touch they pay extra'

"OVERALL: THIS GAME HAS POTENTIAL FOR IFFY CONTENT AS THEY DO NOT CENSOR EMOJIS AND PLAYERS CAN STYALIZE WORDS SO THEY DON'T GET DETECTED AND CENSORED-BUT ROBLOX DOES TRY THEIR BEST TO CENSOR NUMBERS,STREET NAMES, AND BAD WORDS OR STYALISED FORMS LIKE $TrLP to the best of their ability.

"that game is completely based on i have money, you don't.

"And all inappropriate shirts are removed.
",1
"And every swear words get blocked with # so and thats the case!
",1
"If you think Roblox is bad, change you mind!
",5
"I wouldn't let younger kids play this game, however, unless you monitor them.
",7
"Some games have violence, like murder mystery games and games where you escape jail and rob stores.

"You can also talk to strangers which could lead to bullying or worse, but there is a reporting system if people are misbehaving.

"Yep, this is NOT a game.

"A lot of parents tend to criticize this game, mostly due to ""their child spending all their money"" when it was their fault not putting protections.
",5
"They can be disgusting when actually dating, or very hilarious when its a kid copying another.
",6
"You can tell due to the roleplay having a really bad storyline or them having bad grammar.
",8
"However, when its kids copying the actual daters, it's no longer harmless.
",8
"It's OK when they are copying the other kids, but oh no.
",8
"I hope someone benefits from this and no, parents do not go to the kids section because they think we don't know any better.

"I was bullied by a bully :( who said creepy things btw it's a virus it will destroy a pc within a few years.and I would not let your kid play it if they can't handle hackers,cursing,violence.
",0
"The only thing I didn't like is some of the scripts broke/glitched.
",2
"And yes, there are bad games that like kill people or abuse people.
",3
"But no, it's not ROBLOX's fault that these games exist.
",8
"And sometimes, there is a scripter that can say bad words because they download these hacks/mods, with the mods, they can draw things, make they're avatar look weird.

"Most of these players can get banned after a few days.

"In the game Adopt Me, you collect pets, care for them, and you can also trade them, they're is a scam called ""trust trade"", with this scam, you need to trade your pet as first, and then the player ""gives"" your pet back.

"However, I have noticed the community and separate features greatly go down hill.

"I think one of the issues that has led to this is the Roblox moderation.

"A mass of people that I meet in Roblox always try to be rude to me, and many other people.

"And not to mention the ""Free robux"" scams, games would appear in the front page left and right because of the massive ammount of bots put into those games so players would put their login info and lose all of their gains over the years.

"However, the billing may be leading up to you basically being scammed.
",8
"""Premium"" is a membership that gives you robux per month, but Premium can mess up on the last day and not give you the robux  you deserved.

"This causes Premium to slowly cancel itself after the expiration date, but not giving you robux.

"Tho parents r BARELY EVER RIGHT!!!!!

"Being a kid, I have asked for Robux, but my parents never let me purchase them.

"Roblox was good until covid-19 there are a bunch of teenagers and I have been in countless games were teenagers have been saying some 'explicit content' things.
",2
"I am eleven and I understand this stuff because I watch rated R stuff, But some kids my age and younger have no idea what that stuff is.
",3
"There is a lot and I mean a lot of swearing.
",2
"SOME roblox youtubers are good as well, But youtubers like Flamingo aren't Flamingo kidnaps people, burns people, makes inappropriate jokes, and he trolls people.
",9
"He also does other things that aren't very, well, appropriate.
",1
"He doesn't cuss or have any 'sex' videos on his channel, But he still isn't very appropriate, He has an effect on people in roblox, I was playing bloxburg and I was a baby and this guy game up to me and said ""Fresh meat"" and started chasing me.
",0
"I love roblox but I try my hardest not to get involved in bad things, In this game called murder mystery 2 not only is there guns and knifes, But there is also more teenagers, They play loud and bypassed ( cuss words that aren't blocked ) audios on they're boom boxes, And while you can mute radios, They also cuss, and do and say things that involve.
",3
"drugs, sex, smoking, swearing, and other things of that.
",1
"Just some advice, Roblox isn't all bad, But youtubers like flamingo and teenagers make it bad.
",2
"Bloxburg does show a good life lesson, If you don't pay your bills your power goes out if you don't eat your starving, If you don't take a shower you get stinky, If you don't work you have a chance of being poor, If you don't have a house then you can't get up your moods, just that stuff.

"FOR ME IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BYPASS THE CHAT FILTER AND YOU CAN'T EVEN TYPE NUMBERS.

"Many of the more popular games tend to have 25k+ or more players on it, so the chances of your kid ever stumbling upon a game such as this is incredibly slim.

"Roblox's cesnor is a little bit too harsh, because you can not type numbers, and if you try to type a long sentence, it's most likely gonna censor it because of roblox's rule of privacy.

"The only problem is that people use different hacks to swear.
",1
"Almost every game I join someone uses keys like *&^ to swear.
",5
"Yes there are shooter games and violence.

"The inappropriate content parents find their kids on is their fault for not teaching their kids common sense.
",7
"There are people who byepadd the filter and customer service isnt always the best.
",6
"There are kid friendly games and games that arent as kid friendly.
",3
"The reason people are getting hacked is giving out their information and trying to get free robux.
",5
"Scrolling through parents reviews, I was kind of alarmed by some of the things they were saying.
",8
"If anything, the ROBLOX chat censers out TOO much.
",4
"Kitsune was censored, and so are all inappropriate words.
",0
"Also, tell your kids not to swear!
",7
"We shouldn't be.
",0
"Many parents insist that their kids learned swear words from ROBLOX.
",8
"I'm a middle schooler, and I can tell you that kids there drop F-bombs all over the place.
",9
"I know you'd like to think your kids don't swear, but they do.
",7
"Parents are getting mad at ROBLOX because their kids spent all of their money on robux.
",6
"You're blaming ROBLOX for the fact that your child stole your credit card, found where to buy robux, bought them, put in all of your information, and bought robux?
",7
"Not only is this unlikely, but how is that ROBLOX's fault?
",2
"I have a lot of problems with these reviews, but if I go on this review will be the length of a novel.
",1
"First off: No, Roblox is NOT filled with pedophiles.
",3
"If they’re stubborn and won’t accept alternatives, grounding would be a much better punishment so they can understand and learn what’s right and what’s wrong, and what isn’t appropriate for them yet.
",4
"A good example would be some people with a boom box playing inappropriate audio, or others attempting to bypass the chat filter Roblox has placed.
",1
"You can report multiple features if they violate Roblox’s ToS, from shirts to models to games.
",1
"There are almost no ways to make robux without spending at minimum, 5 USD on it.
",6
"In games like natural disaster survival, it has barely any game passes, but it’s a game where you can die by (you guessed it) natural disasters, which could be for educational purposes and teach them the aspects of floods or volcanos, however I recommend them being a little older for games like those.
",8
"Also keep in mind that most children tend to not tell or hide what they’re doing because they’re afraid of consequences from the parent, such as being yelled at or spanked.
",7
"There is bad people on chat but you can turn off chat and that is my only complaint
",1
"I have read other reviews saying that kids bought Robux (Roblox's virtual currency) without permission.
",6
"There are inappropriate games, but they get taken down quickly, and the accounts are poison banned.
",5
"Yes, there are bullies, but every online game has bullies in one way or another.
",2
"If you don't want to hear that, stay out of Murder Mystery 2.
",7
"If you think the game is to violence or to scary for the kid, don’t let them play it.
",3
"Games like jailbreak, piggy (only the piggy), scary elevator, etc don’t let them play it.
",0
"2) Sexual or bad words.
",1
"A lot of words are censored or tagged, but some words like damn (some consider that a bad word but mostly it just kids use it as a feeling or expression).
",1
"Sexual things are also censored, unless it cloths and it disappears or doesn’t appear, it’s just some bugs in the game.
",3
"A lot of people say mean things or bully which it’s surprising since people bully anywhere.
",4
"And don’t blame Roblox on sexual thing.
",3
"It’s the players you should be blaming.
",7
"And if there are people who are annoying or don’t use good grammar, just don’t worry because a lot of people are annoying.
",2
"And don’t expect players to have good grammar.
",3
"Some are kids, don’t expect them to have instantly good grammar.
",5
"I’m 13 and I sometimes don’t have good grammar.
",1
"A lot of games are bad but if you feel like they should not play it, don’t let them play it.
",7
"Adopt me is a okay game but theirs a lot of mean people and you can just close the chat or ignore them.
",5
"I see a lot of people fight mean people or ignore them.
",3
"Report them if they are constantly bullying someone or your kids, like I said the people who work on the game can fix or do something about it.
",7
"And their are a lot of people who stand up for someone like in a game called loomian legacy (a Pokémon like game) a person was really rude and mean to people who were bisexual or they like different genders.
",8
"6) Roblox said that kids should not tell other people their private messages and other things people should not know.
",7
"And you should not blame the game since the game have a lot of info for the parents to know what the kids should not do
",7
"I get it, 600 workers vs over millions of users, but like once I said ""Green"" in ROBLOX and it got tagged and said #####
",6
"Once I was in a game someone said ""***k"" and it didn't get tagged
",0
"I don't know about violence cause it's Lego characters shooting each other, so I don't think it's to violent
",3
"The ban system is stupid, like seriously, Flamingo get's banned for saying ""Yes""
",2
"I think the moderation just needs a serious improvement, the moderaters should just search ""Adopt Me"" or ""Free Robux"" and see all the g
",4
"Any bad words will be filtered out.The violent side is not too bad.Dying is just like little Lego bricks and there is rarely blood and if there is, it is just little red squares.It teaches kids to persevere, how to save money and how to look after a family.
",2
"but you might get scammed.
",7
"people can send bad messages.
",8
"You do play with other people so there’s a potential for bullying.
",4
"Not many people are rude but you will come across some people that are.
",1
"But, there can be some inappropriate games/content that may not be suitable for your kids.
",1
"In Roblox, if you swear or say anything inappropriate or numbers (for the child's safety), it will be usually censored.
",1
"Roblox can have some inappropriate games on it.
",1
"But if you want your child to not see these types of games, you can either delete the app or monitor whatever your child is doing on Roblox as people could swear and there could be inappropriate things in Roblox games.
",7
"Violence.
",0
"By far I have not seen any games which include blood and gore but some of them may be not suitable for your kids.
",3
"I say you need it because people pretty much make games only to gain robux.
",7
"When you first make your account you will need to choose your gender, and then it will automatically put a terrible avatar that you MUST change buy using robux or free clothing.
",5
"You need to change your avatar as you may be bullied or just be discriminated in the game and be called as ""Bacon Hair"" or other names like that.
",5
"But the reason why robux can be expensive because if you would make a website which millions of people log on to everyday, wouldn't you make a in-app purchase which is expensive?
",6
"Without robux, the developers of the game wouldn't even earn any money!
",9
"So I play Roblox for 2 years now and I thought there are some violence in this game but who you guys blame ROBLOX,Game Devs
",3
"THE PERSON YOU SHOULD BLAME IS YOU,YOU THE ONE THAT LET YOUR CHILD PLAY THIS SO DEAR ALL THOSE STUPID PARENTS PLEASE STFU YOU THE ONE LET YOUR CHILDREN PLAY SO IT'S NOT ANYONE PROBLEM JUST ONLY YOU.

"but they dont ever take action with people u report and they dont ever care about who u report
",4
"so to parents out there...
",7
"
",0
"dont let your kids play roblox.... my mom wont let me, i am perfectly happy with that.
",7
"roblox is a bad place, and someone asked me to be their girlfriend soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yeah.
",9
"it is also got a lot of bad things like trading centers and dating centers they replaced the word Sex with Six as well so u can talk about and pretend like u are having sex in the game which is nasty
",3
"u can also adopt other players as your kid is it gross?
",8
"please just don't playyy itttt!!!!
",4
"it is horrible... it is unsafe... it is so unsafe my mom doesn't let me play it...
",0
"it is horribily not safe.
",4
"The moderation bot is just sad.Reporting does nothing dont even bother reporting because of bullies or swearing.And a game got content deleted but its original.Worst of all its so easy to hack and social engineer the admins.And dont even get me started on exploiting.No one cares if you exploit LOL.The people that care is probably the devs,owner,and admin of the game.
",0
"It is a safe game, and parents complain about their ""5 year old child learning bad words and getting violent and depressed"".
",4
"Roblox doesn't cause this, you being a bad parent does.
",7
"Go and drink your alcohol and go abuse them, don't blame it on roblox for being a bad parent.
",5
"Note: There IS some violence, but not much blood apart from in specific games that you can stop your child from playing.
",3
"Mostly, it's just touching people with various weapons until their health goes down and they die (break into a few pieces).
",3
"Extremely scary games but you know what imma say so check someone else's review out.
",3
"I have tons of friends who downloaded this in kindergarten and for me that feels not okay but I was just allowed to download this and for me privacy isn’t a concern.
",0
"There is no blood or anything and when you die you just fall apart into BLOCKS so it’s not like it’s gory.
",3
"You can’t write numbers in the chat so it’s impossible to write phone numbers, addresses or ages.
",1
"You can’t write names either.
",1
"Words like crap will be hashtags  and so will other swears.
",1
"Just don’t buy this game for young kids.
",6
"The game is only good for people who are 13 and above because of the “safe-chat”and limited privacy settings for users under 13 years of age.
",4
"The “safe-chat” system blocks users under the age of 13 to type for example numbers in the chat.
",1
"There is innaproprate chat and some bad games.
",7
"Dont play bad games like jailbreak, prison life, and gang up on people simulator.
",3
"Never ever let your child access your money in roblox, roblox involves LOTS of money, 1 cent per  a online dollar, the more money you pay, the more discount you get, I suggest going and buying a giftcard instead of using a credit card.
",4
"There is setting that help you stop chat because some people bypass roblox filter and say bad things, but it isn't always like that and you can report it to roblox so they can fix it.
",1
"I suggest not joining Club games.
",7
"Some games are about death so watch out for those, I suggest playing the games first before your child.
",7
"Ok, first off if you don't have online access, this will just waste 15 minutes of your day installing it, and then uninstalling it.
",6
"Even when you install it, it's pretty boring.
",8
"Ok, and I'm not gonna lie, but I'm pretty trash at all the games.
",2
"Probably way better on mobile because the other games on Xbox make Roblox look trash.
",4
"The reviews here say that roblox is pedo-city.
",2
"It honestly isn't.
",2
"Yes there are gory games but it's a few blocks of blood and you think your kid's a murderer.
",8
"If you don't want your kids to see the chat or chat turn of the chat .
",7
"Some they shouldn't play is Piggy,Puppet ,ant horror game .
",3
"but if your under 7 I wouldn't recommend it because if your under 7 you just wouldn't understand chatting, and gun games for 5 year olds?
",7
"I rated it 7+ because the violence is very cartoony, also I think common sense media needs to update the age rating because all the sex problems are gone.
",2
"also they should remove ratings from 3 years ago or longer ago, because the game changes a lot and ratings from classic roblox should not count.
",4
"also I NEVER SEEN ONLINE DATING EVER THERE'S NO SEX OMG
",8
"i am VREY diss[pted with robloc, me and my bestie EmilyWoman77 were p;laying meep city, when i got groomed by BigPappyGuac and BigMuscleManFelix.

"No, condo games have been content deleted.
",2
"I TELL YOU, SERACH UP ANY WAY TO FIND THEM, AND THE ONLY SERACH RESULTS YOU GET IS CONTENT DELETED.

"But it is very consumerist, some games are like: to play the game give me 10 dollars ore else it will be impossible, and a big paywall.
",8
"The minigames are not bad but do get tiring, there can be chat abuse and also in guns games clouds of blood come from dead people when they are shot with realistic looking guns.
",8
"Although with blocky people the blood loks bad.
",6
"I would recomned this game for low teens however they may be bored by it quicky

"The players can be good or just plain out rude sometimes for example ""toxic"" childish people will start picking or harassing other kids minding their own business just to pick up fights.

"It can teach kids things like the game Jailbreak, where it can show kids how being a criminal is hard and it will show that in reality it is even harder.
",3
"It will make kids think 2 times before the do crime in real life.

"Because you play with random people on the site they will end up being inappropriate (Sometimes).
",1
"If this happens you can ask them to stop using the ROBLOX chat feature.
",7
"If this doesn't help, you can report the player; if a player is reported multiple times they will get a message from ROBLOX telling them to stop, otherwise they will get banned.

"ROBLOX does have games with violence and horror so if you are a child ask your parent/guardian if you are allowed to play.

"well ROBLOX is a good websites its got bad things in it most are...hacks with no tags....and alot of it is drugs or smoking make sure to allow only 7 + or 13+ if your kid wants to play roblox

"But, how some people are completely HATING on ROBLOX is unnecessary.
",1
"ROBLOX takes a lot of time to block/delete sex games, or swearing games.

"I only have one concern is to changing safe chat, like if you got hacked and they changed the year you were born to 2020, then you would have to switch accounts because of the safe chat.

"If you are so mad about predators, teach your child some common sense, and to not interact.

"Robux is not needed.

"So stop saying that it is, or complaining because your child is asking for it.

"I've heard a lot of parents tell me about how ""Roblox Moderation is bad"" or ""Roblox doesn't control the bad stuff of their game!""
",2
"But in reality the games or shirts that are strictly prohibited are deleted in less than 1 hour.
",6
"Now on the topic of ""Pedophiles/People getting groomed.""
",8
"Honestly, I think that it's very unusual to come across Pedophiles on Roblox, Because, like we have established, Roblox censors out words that could potentially put your life at a risk.
",4
"You could also catch some ""Online Daters"" on the game but, most of the time they are just 7-9 year olds bored with their lives.
",4
"It is also prohibited to date according to the Roblox Terms of Service (Also the relation ship between Oders (Online Daters) Lasts less than a week lol) People are getting groomed on every kind of website, and its the parents fault for not monitoring their child correctly.
",5
"There are exploiters which can be a problem, and some games have blood.

"Beware of scams that take your robux and account though, ""Free Robux"" does not exist and it only has existed twice, and probably never again.

"CHAT MODERATION
",0
"Roblox is infamous for their flawed automated chat moderation.
",5
"BUILDING
",0
"Also, if you think this game is for creating, turn back right now.
",7
"Adopt Me, and any game that has 'Simulator' in the name is known for in-app purchases being slapped all over the screen.
",8
"These people often bypass the chat filter with swearing, bully/threaten others, use bypassed/inappropriate audios, songs and decals, ONLINE DATE and perform sexual acts by abusing emotes.
",1
"They also may tell you to 'mic up' on Discord where they can say and post anything but a lot of these users are all bark and no bite.
",8
"BUDGETING
",0
"A very large majority of clothing is botted and stolen.
",1
"All of the clothing on the front page catalog is botted.
",4
"There is also a market of 'Limited Accessories' that have changing prices and are only owned by a set amount of players...moving onto scamming.
",5
"SCAMS
",0
"Scamming is a very large issue.
",9
"Not so much in Limited Accessory trading but in bots or stolen accounts that will encourage players to visit phishing links or scam games.
",5
"That link or scam game will then try to trick the user into putting their username and password in.
",5
"If you were to fall victim to one of these scams, there is a good chance that your account was not taken and you can still login, but your account has been used to paste the same message everywhere.
",9
"These scams target bigger fish, aka users with premium and a decent amount of robux.
",9
"Any games with a trading system, Adopt Me, Royale High and Bubble Gum Simulator in particular, are also full of children trying to scam eachother.
",8
"I'm not going to list every scam ever but if you get scammed, it can be a valuable lesson.
",5
"VIOLENCE
",0
"Violence, surprisingly there is not too much violence, with it being more cracked down on than other things... Any games with violence are quickly held for review and you are unable to play until the developer removes it.

",0
"GAMES TO WATCH OUT FOR:
",0
"
",0
"Meep-City
",0
"The dead version of Adopt Me, was once very popular, now there are parties hosted ingame that have many 'Ro-Gangster' like players, who will bypass the chat, play inappropriate audios/songs, have single/'uncuffed' or taken/'cuffed' in their character description, and perform many sexual acts and abuse the house editing system (placing a pole and pole dancing, and doing 'the deed' by abusing the sleeping emote)
",0
"
",0
"Dollhouse Roleplay
",0
"Simila
",0
"Full of Ro-Gangsters, playing loud inappropriate audios and songs.
",3
"Whatever bad audio you think exists, trust me, it is played and bypassed in this game.
",3
"The Streets and Da Hood
",0
"Games full of Ro-Gangsters, doing all of the behaviors listed before as well as using a spray can to use bypassed decals (of highly inappropriate things) and also encourage 'tea-bagging' (search that up yourself.......) and with the main objective of these games being to collect money and chase down and kill other players.
",4
"De Pride Isle Sanatorium
",0
"Disguised as a LGBTQ+ community, gives twisted views on LGBTQ+, race, gender, ideal body type.
",1
"Older versions of the game also had CANNABALISM ingame and Roblox has taken this game down only for it to keep coming back.
",9
"The owner's account is also on their last strike, they are known for being racist, transphobic, homophobic,,,,
",8
"Very toxic community, do not associate.
",2
"Also don't go near any Barbie lookalikes in this game.
",4
"The barbie-lookalike are also found in fashion runway games and you should not play any of these except Boho Salon, Fashion Famous and Roblox's Top Model, which are safe fashion show games.
",8
"There you have it, the bad side of Roblox in a nutshell.
",2
"In conclusion, it is way too hard to moderate what your child is seeing or doing, instead, play with them or don't let them play at all.
",7
"Fun game but very dangerous unsupervised..imagine writing hundreds of words on it
",2
"Scamming happens but (honestly who cares)?
",2
"Inappropriate scamming games get banned so don’t worry.
",8
"I think ""condo,"" cafe, ""escape *insert thing* obby""and ""free robux"" games should not be played.
",3
"These are basically sex games.
",8
"Cafe games are a good concept, but you should NOT let your under 13 child play here.
",7
"Free robux games will steal your account info through fake ""login"" GUIs.
",5
"Most popular obbies/tycoons are fine, but many will try to siphon your child's robux.
",9
"They are usually made in 10 minutes with free obbies, and will try to scam you sometimes.
",5
"i'm not trying to be negative, but roblox isn't a very good game.
",2
"i've played it many times and i have seen some very violent games that include blood and jumpscares that i don't think should be for kids.
",3
"and i know that it isn't Robloxs fault but at least monitor some of the games so it is a little less violent and  just so they know that there can be games like this so younger children don't have nightmares.
",3
"also in roblox games where there are scams for Robux (in-game currency) witch (sorry i'm bad at grammar) kids will go in completing some obby (depending on the template of the world) and will type in their username and password only to find out their account has been hacked.
",5
"DO NOT fall for this trick.
",3
"Now I fell for this once, but there were WAY too much steps.
",2
"There were too many steps and I was impaitent.

"Later i found out it was a scam and if I completed the form, my accout would of  been hacked!

"Violence!

"this is coming FROM a kid.
",2
"I have more bad things to say about Roblox then good, sadly.
",1
"Hundreds of thousands of little kids report people for no reason, so Roblox stopped moderating the reports and focused more on the condo games.
",2
"You are probably wondering why I marked it innapropriate/s*x.
",8
"There are now games called condos in Roblox that are s*x games.
",3
"Most old men are on there, I have accidently gone on one myself I was shocked and scarred (I'm not being overdramatic).

"-18+ Warning- there were men fucking girls in the ass, p**** pictures on the walls, striper poles, boob and p**** body forms and more.
",8
"The emotes were the things that disgusted me most...
",0
"It does have violence in it (weapons) but most games do not have violence at all.
",3
"i have seen my little brother talking and people saying in chat like rape and babe lets hit it it is not the best game your choice if rather let them play  this game
",4
"Roblox is a website for kids.
",6
"So, paranoid parents reading this (because I know that’s what you are if you’re reading reviews on this hellsite), Roblox does not feature swearing, sex, or violence.
",7
"The hashtags are a form of censoring.
",1
"The news is lying to you about this.
",6
"The negative part its a very serious problem like a child abuse, cyber bullying, sexual games, swear words, number swearing, etc
",2
"
",0
"But number swearing i mean its if you account under 13 you CAN'T tell ANY NUMBERS or it will be hastags but all players know the way around it and that way its add word ""cm"" and type the numbers withour a space but don't put it in a word or it will be tags and some people have tags when they say normal word and not swear but it tags and makes every parents see it like that player
",1
"I was not stupid enough to give out my private information to people, besides, you can't anyway, not with the chat filter.
",7
"Theres an game called Ragdoll Engine where there are many racist tik tokers (even tho from now on you can rarely find them) but I think this is supposed to be for age 14 - 18.
",1
"I don’t know why Common Sense set the sex rating so high.
",7
"Disabling filters and the Condo games happen very rarely, and even when they do, Roblox is relatively fast to take it down.
",8
"Roblox is a really good game, but recently I bought 50 dollars in robux so I went on a website to get more and my account got hacked, the hacker did a BUNCH of naughty stuff, and got my account deleted.
",0
"So DONT PLAY IT!
",0
"3.what should I worry about
",7
"A-scams and bullies.Roblox is not safe from scams and bullies,Most scams in roblox are mostly free robux scams due to the fact that most kids don”t have robux from their parents so they type in how to get free robux,they click it,put their password and username,and get scammed and the cycle kinda repeats.and bullies are in mostly roleplay games bullies the poor roblox players cause they have robux.So what is my review on it,this game is mostly okay for 13+ older kids.
",9
"But, you should be careful of Robux scams and bullying because of not having robux.
",8
"Sometimes people will bully you if you don't have robux, but not every server has that kind of behavior.
",7
"Robux scams are made possible with botted accounts that post comments on ""group walls"" that are something like ""Want robux?
",8
"just go to *scam website* and claim now!!
",4
""", there are also comments on item comment sections such as ""this is a weird glitch post this on 3 different items then check your robux"" which are ABSOLUTELY FAKE.
",4
"Now, if your child is under the age of 13, they won't be able to find these kind of games, because they're not approved by the roblox moderators and admins.
",7
"There's also the broken report system, which works, but it's not great.
",1
"And the broken chat filters, which tag things (replace things with hashtags ""#"") such as ""me too"" by mistake.
",1
"But the chat filters don't allow users under 13 to write numbers, I believe this is helpful, so they don't give out their phone number or similar, but it can also prevent alot of conversations, ""there are # stages left until level #"", ""i hit ### followers yesterday!
",5
"There's also another problem, viruses in free models in roblox studio (roblox's tool to create games for other users to play), so you should probably monitor what models your child chooses to get.
",8
"Even though there are killing games etc.
",3
"Don't let your kids start, don't let your friends start, and I don't want to see your finger going to the App Store to type in this cursed app.
",7
"I regret so much in the past five years, so much.
",6
"I regret not spending time with the family when we were camping.
",6
"I regret being so irritable when we didn't have Wi-Fi.
",6
"I regret the time that I spent in another world instead of spending my life in my own.
",0
"Its Pretty bad like on all the games there's in app purchases to obviously to make money.
",8
"Kids will spend hundreds sometimes thousaunds on in app purchases, like this in game currancy called 'robux' that you pay real money for.
",6
"And some little kid was bragging about how hw bought a knife in the game, but get this, the knife costed the same amount of money as the real counter strike.
",9
"in all pretty bad kids game, filled with scambots that your (little) kids will fall, and then complain to you about it, all though it has an amazing youtube community.
",7
"Besides that its a bad game 4/10
",2
"You should be careful about some things though before you play, like talking to strangers, violent games, and scams.
",7
"There are hackers/scams on Roblox too.
",2
"If somebody asks for your personal information or tries to convince you to give them things DON’T give them any information/items.
",7
"Violent games can make children more violent in real life.
",3
"There is no swearing or violence They Censor Swearing and Theres barley any games that have blood but its not graphic.
",3
"You should have one concern If you see A Teenager You should get out of there they will bully kids And They are also very toxic and salty.
",7
"Kids Shouldnt have to go through what i go through everyday.
",7
"Lgjttjjgfukvh
",0
"There are also a few games that don't look quite appropriate.
",2
"For example someone tries to say something inappropriate, it will end up in tags, if they try to say numbers too.
",1
"Unexpected players: Roblox is safe community but you can always find an online dater, bypasser, disrespectful player or an inappropriate user anywhere.
",1
"You can block the player and report making the players chats not being able to be read by your child.
",7
"If your child is getting bullied or they got mad at someone, simply leave the game, if it was a bullying situation, report.
",7
"I've seen many kids on this app called Discord which is for gamers chat and I don't even know how they end up there or how parents approve this?
",8
"You may think it's a scam and it will steal your credit card information but it won't.
",7
"In my personal opinion, robux is ridiculous and a waste of money, sure you can buy in-game gamepasses that give you special perks and dress up your avatar but it doesn't make sense.
",5
"It's basically a waste of money but if your child wants it, try thinking about it but if you say no they might be sad but they will get over it.
",7
"the moderation is not the best but it's ok. the ones who violate the rules can be warning, temp ban and permanently terminate.
",2
"there are almost no sex/drugs/swearing/online date/gore (some people can bypass this but you can report them and they can be terminated forever or at least banned for a long time).
",1
"but there are scripting (a.k.a programming) that too hard for the below 13. there are violence but minimal, not as hard as fornite (13+ usa and 12+ intl) or grand theft auto (17+ usa and 18+ intl).
",8
"Ok,ok so firstly I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
",2
"This game is no aware for kids, like this game has to much sex, language, iffy content, swearing, and inappropriate chatting for dangerous users, this game is not good for teens either, like example your kids want to play it so that thier can chat with thier friends on roblox and start getting popular on roblox, but once when I played this game it was not for a 14 year old and clearly ten year olds should not be playing this at all!
",0
"I am mostly disrespected in Roblox High School.
",8
"Sometimes I wonder ""Why can't Roblox be better?""
",9
"and ""Why does everybody have to be so toxic?"".
",6
"In violence, it depends which game your playing, for example take Piggy.
",2
"It has violence in it, but is acceptable for tweens.
",0
"I was called names like ""noob"", ""boomer"" etc.
",0
"People can also find a way to swear on ROBLOX.
",1
"You cant blame roblox for mean people, it's just the internet, theres always going to be mean people out there.
",2
"But lets face it, there are so many games with in-app purchases these days, so if you blame roblox for that, you're an idiot.
",3
"I don't have the Roblox app myself because my Mum won't let me download it.
",0
"In that one time that I played we went to a restaurant where we saw a customer assaulting a chef.
",0
"He used the F-word several times and the S-word a few times as well.
",9
"xoxo"" After that I declined every offer to play Roblox, even by my best friends.
",6
"If that happened on my first time playing, I can't bear to think what would happen on my 2nd or 10th
",7
"I've also lost a lot of good friends in the duration with it, but it happens.
",0
"People also bypass the filter by saying inappropriate things, but adding symbols, and numbers in between.. Like before, people were able to said ""pen15"" ""pen 15"", which you could obviously realize what that infers.
",1
"And more recently now, there was an ad, to which children clicked it, and it brought them to a child pornography clip, which is..
",6
"In itself, disgusting and disturbing.
",0
"Of course, with that being said, there's predators, and there's pedophiles.
",9
"When I was younger, someone said they were going to kill my mom, and that OBVIOUSLY scared me half to death.
",0
"I contacted my dad, and let him know what they said, and he told me to unfriend him.
",0
"(There wasn't a 'block' button back then, I don't believe.)
",0
"A similar thing happened to me again last year, and I contact administration over it.
",0
"They can disable chats, so the child can't see any chats, therefore they have no visible exposure of a bad person.
",8
"Remember, there could be very violent and vulgar games out there that can really give your child a hard time, it can sometimes make them swear because of rage, and most games for kids are a pain in the ass.
",8
"Most parents think it isn't safe because they never looked at the games their children play.
",2
"You can see some oders or innapropriate games in it so if YOU see a game like that report it and dont play it thank you for Reading
",2
"If a child puts in inappropriate reference in- it will result in the reference becoming hashtags.
",1
"They put into the chat ""f*ck""
",1
"The result when seen in the chat for public would be ""####""
",1
"Kids are learning however, certain ways to bypass the hashtag system and are bypassing by saying the refences in different fonts.
",1
"The player CANNOT take these off, and there is no option to do so.
",3
"Don't think you can let your child play by themselves for a second.
",7
"There have been moments of where the player trades a highly sought for pet and becomes scammed.
",5
"Although the moderation team is very active to ban any pornographic, excessively violent, or scam games, they are not perfect as they must manually search every new game coming in to their site.
",2
"ON THE TOPIC OF SCAM GAMES: these games are very difficult for the mod team to find and close down as they are usually always disused as a very popular game type known as an obey.
",3
"Tell me 1 good reason why ROBLOX is not suitable for anybody under fourteen.
",4
"Kids can build and play games, but there is some bad things in some games like take Piggy for example for ""Mild Blood"".
",3
"People called me names like ""noob"", ""boomer"" etc.
",0
"Roblox's violence can be handled by kids around eight and up, but there is some gory games.
",8
"People can swear even on safe chat, most words are censored on ROBLOX, but people can find a way to swear, like um for example, people can split it like u  m  because of the censorship on ROBLOX.
",1
"The bad parts about the game, is that it is greedy, I have premium on the account ""DinosaurTrexGaming"" and after a day it stops giving me robux, even if I got monthly premium, and it's hard to decide what to play next because most games are very very boring,
",6
"My opinion: Awesome game for tweens.
",6
"To those who think roblox is bad, you're wrong.
",2
"Idk why people think it is bad.
",2
"But it does have a little bit of a lot of cartoon violence.
",2
"The games can be violent but theres thing like adopt me,hangouts and other things (games to stay away from:girls and boys dance club jailbreak if ur under 7 madcity if ur under 7 and alot more,read roblox website for more)In roblox never give away your account by telling or going into a game and giving them your password.

"As you progress in age, you'll find more and more pedophiles on roblox.

"Roblox really does train you to be careful about what you're doing online, and how to interact with disrespectful people.
",6
"will be tagged out), you can expect cussing and really rude references to rape and other such things.
",8
"A lot of people say that roblox is too violent, but what can you expect going into a universe of a billion games?
",2
"No actual graphic or brutal scenes are depicted, and characters are made up of lego like structure, so when you get ""killed"" the body just explodes into pieces.
",3
"What I've said earlier can be overwhelming, and how a game originally designed for innocent gaming and fun has turned into a parallel universe of real life- just taken to an online version, without any consequences.
",9
"Stay away from this game.
",4
"Neopets and Papa louie games are better than this utter piece of crud.

"this is a kid game that your child can play not edgy ass teen child no teen will play this only teen who is not a edgy ass
",2
"Let's talk about the ""Inappropriate"" stuff on Roblox.
",7
"Many parents say that there are predators and such on the platform, but what usually ends up happening is that the predator will add the kid in a 3rd party application such as Discord and Twitter.

"I hate parents complaining about ""predators"" and ""Inappropriate"" games when it can all be avoided if they check up on their child once a week.

"I got a message on roblox today saying I was being violent??

"I hope Roblox changes that and brings my account back as I had so many good stuff and aparently wasted my money for robux on that account!!

"Pls fix this!

"Put an email into the account before playing as it can be dangerous to do so
",5
"There can be some 'violent' games but not every game is like that and the 'violent' games are not that bad some people just over exaggerate.

"Another time my name was ""Dino"" and one person made fun of me because ""I did not look like a dino"".

"It’s not that bad at all though the chat may be violent and some of the games aren’t appropriate for younger players

"and you can report hackers it is true that there are games like arsanal and murder mistery 2 but  gust dont play thoes game easy so you slould play roblox im 8 and i play it so dont say its bad you dont have to get it but dont say its bad.

"so if u get terminated or deleted (Perma ban) you are breaking the rules such as Hacking, Pictures, Adult Content, Trolling, Cyber bullying, Scamming, Giving Your Personal Info and even wanting personal Info so yeah dont break even one of these rules, unless you want an ""Account Deleted""  screen so my review about roblox is that its entertaning they have Sonic games (Which are my favorite games) and more Try Roblox For Free Today for a kids smile!

"They also ban people for no reason and is clearly unsafe.

"Hackers can easily hack Roblox because of it's unsafeness.
",1
"a lot of these games are pay to win.
",8
"a lot of games will incise children with ""cool"" hats, guns and other useless items.
",3
"other games  are premium only or have premium parts of the game locked behind a sum of robux if a child's friend has access to this they might feel left out.
",3
"like most games today robux (the in game currency) can be bought with real money this has lead young children to steal mums purse to buy these robux.

"Some complains that happened about this game.
",7
"If a parent's child spent money (without permission) on the game, it's not Roblox's fault.

"If you parents out there are complaining about the games your child are playing in this website, remember that it is your responsibility to teach the child what and what not to do online.
",7
"You also can get hacked if you arent safe with trades but if you get hacked you will prob learn a good lession (happend to me) DO NOT DO TRUST TRADES
",5
"don't like it people are mean and can swear and do BAD stuff.
",1
"Though there is some violence in the game there selves, there is not a lot.
",3
"But like the internet, there are many scams.
",1
"Any kid reading this, anything sounding too good to be true is almost certainly a scam.Parents reading this should be aware of scams and educating kids can go a long way with ROBLOX and beyond.
",2
"But there will be people who will be toxic and be mean to players.
",1
"There are also solutions to this, just hide the chat.
",1
"Stay away from every 18+ games as ROBLOX will almost instantly remove them nowadays.
",5
"Great game but some aspects are too violent and bullying is common and hackers are found in most games.
",1
"Yes I will say that it has a few transactions, but just teach you kid to be safe with money and teach them how not to be scammed if something seems fishy don't trust it.
",7
"free stuff doesn't exists.
",8
"If you don't want your kid encountering a somewhat violent game (which roblox does have) just moderate you kid and tell them you don't want them playing that game.
",7
"I just wish they didn't remove guests and tix.
",8
"But people do use bad grammar to be funny, but even so.
",1
"When you get killed there is no blood you're body splits apart and you say oooooffffff.
",3
"Basically why it’s 4 stars is because there MAY or may not be some bullying, and people bypassing the filter, and maybe people trying to find online daters.
",1
"Make a unique password: Yes scamming and PGing (Password Guessing) is a thing, so do not make a easy password to guess (e.g: iloveroblox, noob1233).
",3
"So kids, don’t listen to what other parents say about ROBLOX being ""unsafe for children"", yes it may have predators, but just ignore them.

"Hello, i'm not saying that roblox sucks, but there are some tall pepole with skeleton legs, that follow you everywhere.

"Then my small brother tryed it and he got nightmares!

"But Roblox is not the #1 game suitable for kids, there is some bad games and bad content.

"The bad things about Roblox is..... #1: I was five and I was playing Roblox High School on my tablet and then it kicked me out.

"#2: Roblox is greedy, I got a gift card for my 7th birthday and a week later my robux was gone.
",0
"#3: Roblox keeps saying they removed lag but they didn't.

"they do not allow curse words to be used.
",1
"but i recommend kids above 10 years play this game because there are a few games that are violent for young kids
",3
"YES people find others swearing at the children, but remember that not everyone is safe online, and also remember that some games in ROBLOX aren't always mean't for ""kids"".
",1
"You guys just don't know.
",2
"Note: Robux is the currency and you need to buy a lot for stuff, which i dont like.
",6
"Although, there are a lot of scammers.
",2
"I wish Roblox could improve on stopping people and bots from scamming other players.
",0
"roblox is dangerus bc of hackers and it encorage kids to steal their parents money
",3
"So i started roblox when i was young lets start this off by saying i was not ready for what was coming.
",0
"I was not ready for the following.
",4
"I accidentally scammed many people because i thought they were giving me stuff for free when they got mad at me i did not understand why.
",0
"I am quitting for newcomers because: Games have gotten money hungry and pay to win if you are considering downloading roblox for a kid please note that i ended up spending hundreds of dollars on the in game currency ''robux'' This was defenitly more fun in 2017.
",7
"The only game i really like is piggy, sorry piggy you just lost a player.
",0
"Another thing to note is that roblox has a lot of issues with the app itself and many of the games.
",2
"Roblox crashes a lot for mobile users.
",6
"There are cheaters, exploiters , online daters, scammers, hackers, bulliers, and so on.
",8
"The chat can get scary and violent.
",1
"Millions of reports come in everyday and roblox does not do anything about it.
",6
"Roblox has brought me up to 8 hours on the app and i am only supposed to be on my tablet 3 hours a day let alone a game for 8 hours what i am trying to say is that its very addicting and a lot of kids will become addicted fast and miserable when you take roblox away from them im sorry i just cant do this anymore.
",0
"This is coming from a ten year old user.
",4
"So yeah, this game is a wild card, you should monitor your children, and set up barriers so they don't join violent games.
",5
"The report feature is trash though, and you do have to beware of the free robux scams (which will hack your account and possibly install viruses on your PC).
",8
"So there are some bad games out there but let's be real.
",1
"There is absolutely no way  that any platform/website/game can have a fun anti-hack system.
",1
"It's literally impossible.
",9
"Don't fall for the free robux games.
",5
"They just steal your password.
",7
"Cussing.
",0
"The same amount of kids in real life will cuss just as much as people on roblox.
",1
"There is no way to prevent older adults to stop cussing fully.
",1
"Bad games just leave them it's plain and simple.
",7
"Online bullies can't be stopped just ignore them or leave the game it's easy I promise.
",7
"Reporting is iffy and there is scamming no denying to that.
",1
"There is inappropriateness but just monitor your kid.
",7
"Stay on alert for child predators and sexual predators.
",2
"I'm disappointed by it.
",0
"The OBC cost is literally OUTRAGEOUS!!
",6
"It seems like the Moderators only accept FALSE reports.
",2
"Also kids get bullied for not having the latest ""Trends"".
",4
"It's just crap.
",7
"Don't even bother.
",1
"You get hacked, reports don't work.
",6
"There are some good and bad things in this game, first I will tell you bad things.
",3
"There are so many exploiters that could hack the game and make some scripts, I know one script that is violent and it is called Grab Knife, also there are some sex scripts not for kids.
",3
"There are so many scam games that have free robux and they are scamming everyone, also there are players that lie that they buy robux for everyone, but they get hacked and they can't get their account back.
",8
"There are some bullies that are richer and they bully newbies, but newbies could be insulted, even if you don't have robux, they still bully you.
",1
"The game has age rating for the people who hated it dont worry it safe but adopt me and meep city and raise a grow family isny for kids there are many online dater there and if you see the people said tags because the game has a filter the filter tags bad word letters etc.
",3
"And if you get builled jsut ignote it or report it but reporting will take a long time to get t hem know what going on because there are little admin and many player you have to wait and if you say it scams you it does not there a virtual system to currency and if you say its not for kid just let them play obbys not the adopt me and meepcity and dont fall for the free robux there are people who bully rigth u can change youre avater just click avatar amd if you see some lego thingy you said it isnt lego it h
",3
"It was supposed to be a app for children of all ages, but they failed and got a ""Everybody 10 and up"" rating.
",0
"The bad stuff about Roblox is one time I was five and I was playing Roblox High School on my Android Tablet.
",0
"It kicked me out!
",0
"1 week later after I used it my robux was gone.
",0
"Roblox keeps saying they removed lag but I played Roblox High School 2 and it was lagging so hard!

"And some lag here and some lag there and more lag everywhere!

"Customer Service will not help they will just repeat the exact same messages.
",3
"(Online Daters, Inappropriate creations,  and other things that go against ROBLOX's Term of Service)
",8
"this can have great messages and other stuff but despite the chat blocks out inoproperit or harmful words people find other ways to say it and There has even been people dating or worse.
",1
"One being that the game is destroying children’s brains and messing with their well-being, and the other is that it’s not harmful at all.
",3
"But at the same time there will always be bypassed audios, ads, and names that your child could see or hear while playing an innocent game.
",7
"I Personally don’t understand why parents go out of their way to make sure everyone knowstheir experience was bad, but they don’t think about the odds of these things happening.
",4
"In the past month I have seen maybe 2 bypassed audios, 1 bypassed shirt, and 0 bypassed games, those are really low odds for your child to see one of the following.
",1
"In the end, yes, Roblox can have some inappropriate people, but that doesn’t mean the game is bad overall.
",1
"One thing that dont really like about roblox is the consumerism.
",2
"When you make a free account and dont want to pay for anything, the free items you get is bad.
",5
"The only problem is there is some bullying and some bad words do slip in through the chat filter.
",1
"If you are okay with ur kids seeing some bad words then you should totally play this game.

"Nasty games

",4
"If they got rid of the chat, I would agree that it is 10+ because of some possible violence in games.
",2
"I feel like I am mature for my age, but I don't enjoy playing this game because it can get sexual and there can be language sliding past the so-called 'filter', while I just want to play a game and enjoy doing so.
",6
"I would recommend teens 14 and up to play this because of many concerns and please trust me, I am not joking when I say that this game can be quite dangerous.
",4
"The reason I give it 4 stars is people are copying stuff for example take Piggy, people upload stuff like ""Piggy 2 [REAL]"" and ""Piggy chapter 3"" and I don't like the customer service.
",4
"They are just like a bunch of robots writing random names and generating random messages!

"The logo is so bad man I mean like go to Wayback Machine and click something like 2014 or 15 and look at how good the logo was back then!

"There are many more examples, but I can’t go on all day.

"Too much violence.

"I play Roblox alot but this isnt about my feelings on the game it's about what I think of its age stuff I guess first of all there are tons of scammers or account stealers with stuff like fake free robux sites that take your account info and game specific scammers like in adopt me

"Jailbreak is also okay for kids, because the game has violence, police use guns, rob banks, and the game is inappropriate for little kids, so may have to know what is game and what is real life.

"And avoid free robux games because they are scamming your account.

"The players that try to bypass the server always 97% know each other and bully other players when the others say they will report them.

"Robux: Please do not let your child go onto sites or games claiming they will give 'free robux' as they are run by hackers or scambots and will infect your PC with a virus and may even steal the victim's account to use it for 'free robux' scams.

"The reason why it is not best to put in your card details onto your child's account is becuase if they do get addicted to Roblox, they may start purchasing Robux with your card details or make secret purchases without you knowing leading to the worst case sceneario, it being your bank account being emptied .
",7
"From 2007 to 2016, Tickets(Often Referred to as Tix) was basically robux but you did not have to pay for it so when Roblox removed Tix (which was really selfish), there was an controversy as players who didn't or couldn't get Robux had to pay now or just deal without.
",8
"Scams: Scams have been an often problem on Roblox for so long now, everybody just acts like it is normal.

"90% of these ""childish"" players often use foul language, make very racist and offensive remarks, are very easily angered, and use horrible grammar, punctuation, capatilization, and spelling.
",1
"Many of them create very violent games (most copying or TRYING to copy popular rated ""M"" games) and many of them (even most who are younger than 13 years old) are so desperate enough to online date and ask for boyfriends and girlfriends on a KIDS WEBSITE.
",8
"If they don't do that then they waste their lives away asking for each others personal information (yes, some ""kids"" do this), asking for each others account information, and doing other various and inappropriate things such as placing links to porn sites on the forums (which has already happened various times), imitating sex on ROBLOX games (Believe it or not, YES, kids do imitate sexual intercourse on ROBLOX.

"And some even comment before they have, or while they have ""virtual sex"" saying inappropriate things such as ""Oh, my 6-foot ***** is gonna *** all over you.

""", or making groaning/moaning sounds as if they were actually doing it.
",3
"And one huge factors is that when some immature kids do all of these things, it's visible and completely unveiled to basically all the players in the game and/or on the website (which means you're innocent child will most likely be COMPLETELY different after he happens to find and play with the wrong people which is very common as almost 90% of the community is like this).
",3
"Until the day when ROBLOX steps its game up to protect the younger, innocent players, I DO NOT recommend this game for a child under the age of 12, but it all depends on the childs maturity and the watchfullness of the parents.
",2
"The thing is, the website developers, ROBLOX, didn't make most of these games.
",2
"These games can be made by anyone, leaving lots of room for violent, vulgar, content.

"Most numbers are censored so info can't be passed like passwords and addresses.

"Any serious swears like the f word and n words are also censored although there are bypasses which usually are shamed and banned.

"the roblox problems are mostly the community's fault, not roblox's.
",3
"one bad thing about this game is that there is robux which costs money this is used to update your avatar or get things for the games that you play!

"No matter the age of your account, all swears and sexual phrases will be censored, but people still finds a way to bypass the sistem.
",1
"The bypass usually stops working after not a long while later ( since roblox  banned that method) but people still find ways.
",6
"I really didn't notice anything bad on there.
",6
"Make sure your children aren't playing any games called anything like ""Free Robux"" ""Free Premium"" Or ""Free item generator"".
",7
"If there is any games with anything in the title or thumbnail saying ""Free [Blank] Generator"" Don't let them play it.
",8
"The report system: The report system isn't that good.

"If the player has an inappropriate username, it's easier for them to be banned.

"Is Roblox violent?
",0
"Some strict parents may say that it is, but honestly, it really isn't.
",1
"The only ""Violent"" games have, non-violent killing (they have no gore-y blood or detailed death), and obby games (which I already said wasn't violent, it just has your character breaking into pieces like a Lego).
",2
"The people who say ""Roblox is violent"" are overreacting.
",1
"AS LONG AS YOU MONITOR YOUR DANG CHILDREN ON THE INTERNET!
",0
"There's many problems that have arised somewhat recently.
",4
"Filter bypass was already an issue since forever but the chat filter implemented was flawed, banning numbers that are crucial for teamwork.
",1
"Spam bots have become a problem a few years ago, sending messages to random accounts and promising them ""Free"" robux (the premium currency) and stealing the accounts of the poor souls who believe them, carrying the message to whoever is on the friends list.
",9
"Overall, the platform is like a minefield where each mine is concealed, but poorly enough that a user over the age of 12 will be able to see through it.
",1
"If someone tries to swear, it is blocked by a hashtags system.
",1
"For example, if I was to try to say the f-word it would come out as this: ####.
",1
"If you are wondering about inappropriate games, for example a game involving s*x, it is usually taken down by a moderator in minutes.
",5
"Roblox is for kids, i gave it four stars because of this:

"Some issues I have with this game is that the moderators aren't really that great, the moderators have problems with it's ban system and bypassed system, most likely because ROBLOX uses more bots and less real people for moderators.

",7
"besides, there are roville and rocitizens for free; blaming roblox because their kid are swearing, while they learned it in real life, and maybe even learned from their parents; blaming roblox for having bullies, while there are real bullies in real life going online and trolling; and WORST of all, saying that roblox is as bad as GTA5, and Call of Duty is even LESS VIOLENT than ROBLOX?

"A lot of parents complain about their kids being scammed, bullied, and blame it on Roblox.

"This is 2020, There’s a lot of hackers and they will stop at nothing to steal your accounts.

"Roblox aren’t the scammers here it is out of their league to control the thousands, no millions of hackers out there....
",8
"3) Dealing with bullies.
",1
"Firstly a lot of kids beg their parents for robux(an In game currency) because they get bullied for not having them due to 1 reason, only obtainable by purchasing it.
",5
"You have to understand that this “robux” is only owned by 10% of the player base and it is absolutely normal that you do not have robux.
",5
"It would take at most 2 weeks to get a reply so please do not blame them.
",6
"Roblox is probably the worst website in the world as of now for children and teens in general.
",9
"There is a ton of bullying and fighting on this website and people curse all the time.
",1
"The community is made up of rude, immature, dirty minded people.
",9
"There is a a lot of scary violent games on this website like Piggy where they turn Peppa Pig into a murderer and people call each other noob all the time especially if you don't have robux.
",8
"There is also a lot of disturbing content on this game.
",8
"In roleplaying games people try to have sex and girls dress like sluts on this website to impress boys.
",8
"This game shows very clearly how much online society has rotted .
",0
"This game is fun but has privacy issues.
",2
"But usually these are scams.
",2
"Some of these games that claim the give you free Robux games ask you to sign in again NEVER do that they're just trying to steal you username and password.
",5
"Simulators are mostly time wasting games.
",6
"It's all these toxic online daters, and kids that will usually bother you, and not understand that you them to go away.
",7
"Probably the most annoying/disappointing part of the community.
",9
"Now, this has been said a lot, but online dating can be dangerous, a normal player can end up being a 40 year old man in real life, also, it's against the roblox ToS.
",0
"The safe chat, that's another problem.
",4
"If you are under 13, numbers you write in the chat will be censored.
",1
"Even though, today, those things are mostly prevented by other players, and dont even happen anymore, the safe chat still censors numbers and other innocent words, like languages, I mean, why cant you be able to speak a language like Romanian in roblox because you're under 13, and the safe chat will take it as a bunch of spammed letters, which I don't see the point in censoring!
",1
"Roblox is inappropriate for children there are a lot of fights and people curse which isn’t good for children.
",1
"There is also  a bunch of bullying.
",9
"Also some games THAT seem to be for role playing with friends actually have people having sex and other inappropriate things.
",1
"The language in some of the games is really inappropriate and is appropriate for young children.
",1
"The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the moderation is garbage at times.
",2
"Sometimes it won't let you say simple words with safe chat.
",1
"There are also some inappropriate games that don't get taken down for hours.
",8
"I understand that there are tons of other things moderators have to fix but these games are so easy to find.
",2
"Another note, don't listen to the reviews criticizing games because all ROBLOX games are user generated and it's not ROBLOX's problem they have hackers or if they just don't like the games people make.)
",9
"Now I been seeing some reviews of parents saying That Their kids' grades have dropped, I wouldn't blame Roblox, I have always been an A+ and B+ Student and I still am, and I don't just play Roblox for an hour, I play up to more than 5 hours, Now one thing is that you have to watch out for your kids asking you for robux, Robux is like money for the games so you can make your character look nice, If your kid has roblox on Mobile, You could give them robux that's only 99 cents!
",7
"I seriously don’t get why some parents are saying that Roblox.
",2
"Is a super inappropriate game listen you can monitor your CHILD.
",7
"Please don’t just come and judge the game.
",3
"Almost every single game is free, many good peoples, pretty funny memes and chat filter but now let's talk about the cons: Almost every single game is heavily monetized, chat filter is not very good, people can bypass chat filter by simply doing something like this f%$rick, many hackers that are making games full of adult content, some predators etc.
",1
"I'm polish so I'm not good at English
",8
"This game is the worst!
",2
"Child predators are now  on the game!
",2
"Robux bots are  scamming innocent children.
",8
"ROBLOX moderators are quickly removing the sexual games that are not kid-friendly from the site.
",1
"Great game i don't understand why the parents are going crazy over a CHILDRENS game sure can say hell but you say s*** and b**** infront of you child so ya'll can shut up about it its child friendly and can teach (look up math it works) coding,math, and reading!
",7
"It’s not ROBLOX’s fault that you don’t pay attention to your kids because they are only admins of the game not your kids baby sitter.
",7
"Yes roblox can have inappropriate things in it but that’s because young kids think it’s fine to bypass the chat filter.
",1
"If you end up finding out that your kid is online dating and is involved with inappropriate thing it YOUR fault for not paying attention to YOUR kid.
",7
"So don’t go saying it’s ROBLOX’s fault for your kid being involved in bad things
",7
"but I don't like a bit of it.
",2
"my parents don't allow this ""Robux"" so I never got Robux

"also roblox players are very toxic and mean.

"people say 'you suck' when they lose to you and people also scam and advertise in the chat saying ""(website which leads you to a scam)'.

"In any game people are going to try and break the rules.
",8
"Games that are bad and breaking rules are taken off the website.
",2
"If you want your child to be safe on the internet you have to teach them what a online scam is.
",7
"Even if your kid is watching a video it can still scam people.
",7
"You should teach your kids about scams before there first time on the internet.
",7
"Also if you are going to give your kid your phone and they find a bad games you should just watch your kids better Karen.
",7
"None of them are inappropriate at all.
",2
"This game does not have any sex in it.
",1
"It’s not perfect, it has a couple of flaws.
",6
"Firstly, most of the updates are not good in 2020.
",1
"The moderation is not that good in Roblox to be honest.
",2
"Just make sure your children do not fall for those free adopt me pets, or free robux scams.
",7
"It's extremely hard to moderate every single bypass, so don't blame the company.
",2
"A lot of people don't accept the fact the Roblox has tons of benefits and I wish they did.
",4
"It's a fun game but there is a real problem with moderators-when u report someone, nothing happens and even though strong language is moderated, people are always bullying and getting away with it.
",1
"My sibling got up 4 in the morning every day just to play!
",9
"A lot of parents are literally oblivious to what it really is!
",7
"I've been harassed and bullied on this game plenty of times and nothing has happened to the bullies.
",0
"I also know that from my friends experiences, if you're not mature enough then you'll meet some pretty dodgy people.
",5
"Many say that the chat is very bad, but it is censored for players under 13 and can even be turned off!
",1
"Some games are violent, but the game is very cartoony and blocky, almost similar to Minecraft.
",3
"The only problem is ROBUX.
",2
"So 75 dollars in all.. then after a few days i really don’t know why, but the app started charging him more money then what we payed for.

"My dad had to call our bank, and i really don’t think he got the money back.
",0
"And now that my dad doesnt have a job all that 300 dollars are being wasted on nothing.

"I think my dads credit card info got stolen and i got really sad when it happened.

"I think it would be better to buy Roblox gift cards instead cause Roblox doesn’t have a safe security.

"But there can be cyber bullying a lot, mostly 10 or 9 year olds keep bullying people.
",4
"Really weird Ik.. You can’t tell your age in Roblox and it’s safe for children but you can get harassed sometimes.. coUgH.

"roblox gotta fix their website god dangit stop giving me games that only like 6 year old kids who dont know any better play oml fix ur filter plz stop removing good features and adding horrible ones like do i care about a stupid popular among premium??
",4
"i mean roblox does give ur kids some creativity but filter kicks in and filters ur game title and the description turning it to a hastag fest.
",4
"the filter is a joke too u cant say numbers but u can say the f word by adding or replacing a couple letters.

"roblox has to fix their website
",6
"But my negative side of this is the games that aren't moderated until a specific time.
",3
"There are s** with an average of 300 people playing them.
",3
"Roblox is Not the best game but it's a perfect example of the internet.
",2
"In roblox anything and I mean everything can happen there are people who have   abused children while bypassing the swear filter although it is rare but the chance of this happening is once every 2 years or so.
",1
"another thing is that people can go into games and start saying bad things by bypassing the swear filter it's sort of the same thing but it isn't targeted against anyone.
",1
"Adopt Me isn't a bad game at all but the problem is that it is too big for roblox in fact in one case on may  its ""dress your pets"" update made over 1.6 Million people for playing that's great for them but terrible people will create fake games that looks seriously like adopt me
",2
"So little kids will fall for it, they will ask kids for their password but even if you put a fake password they will still be able to steal your password

"
",0
"So I want you to know incase if someone you know or you likes the game adopt 
",7
"A scam game and they log out later
",0
"All of that is gone
",8
"Down the drain including the account forever unless if you have proof that you own the account and that is in rare cases you might get the account back all.
",5
"A sad thing is that robux is fairly expensive and without robux you cant do as much stuff on robux.another thing is that people will swear but if so just leave or block them.
",6
"I know sometimes you will encounter a preditor but if they send you kids a link that's not David bazuskis(CEO of Roblox) problem it's your son's for not having any common sense it's so stupid how many bullshit reviews  on this website therehthere are this all coming from me a avid Roblox player (being on Roblox for 9 years) the only reason I didn't rate Roblox a 5 star is beacuse of the Karen's that spend 1000s of pounds and their account gets baned so uhh yea it's not like the account was terminated that's
",6
"Parents should take note that on online games/activities there a violence suchs as bombs, swords, guns etc.
",8
"Yes, there may be bad games but if your child has common sense then they shouldn't even join them, but games like Jailbreak and Arsenal aren't really bad as you might think when you look at the title, don't judge a game by its title, Jailbreak and Arsenal are meant for having fun, not making you robbers or shoot someone, and yes you can kill cops in Jailbreak, but there is ZERO amount of blood shown.
",3
"And if you do see bad stuff like swearing and other bad content, you can report it.
",7
"And please don't fall for Robux scams as they don't work.
",7
"Also, Roblox has not many, but really good pros and has very small cons and big cons which involve you or your parents money getting stolen.
",4
"And this brings us to the scam chapter.
",6
"If you see in the recommended ""ADOPT ME - FREE PETS"", do not go there.
",6
"It looks so Identical that even an 8 year old could get scammed.
",4
"Please do not let your child play them, or do not go in them yourself.
",7
"It is very dangerous in two ways.
",8
"You can see something awful, and get banned.
",5
"Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about language which I think Roblox does not care about at all and tags innocent things and doesn't tag bad things.
",1
"There is safe chat to keep younger audiences safe, but all it does is make them frustrated.
",4
"It really frustrates little kids when they can't say the numbers, but I see why Roblox did that, for a stupid reason that no 8 - 12 year old would do.
",4
"Fix your system, Roblox.
",7
"I mean.. Why do parents think ROBLOX is a bad game?
",2
"Inappropriate games.
",0
"If you die it’s just like un-attached lego pieces in the floor, and blood is just a red spot.
",3
"Also, if Roblox is reading this, please make it so that whenever you do a certain thing, you get Robux because with the monthly payment that comes with it it's really slow to come through because, well haven't you read what I said earlier, it's monthly.
",7
"There are chat bubbles sure, but Roblox can filter it out if it's inappropriate or rude.
",1
"Sure what I like is good ol' horror games and bloodshed buuuuuut I can't post it on YouTuber.
",0
"Cons: Your biggest concern should be your kid getting hacked, or scammed, because roblox moderation is pretty bad, but still doesn't let 18 plus content from being shared.
",7
"Now to scamming, many games, like adopt me or murder mystery 2 have trading in them, including the site itself, if you have a young kid, tell them to not trade with others if you feel that they could be scammed, now hacking, the only ways this could happen is if you download a virus or get a bad web extensions, or if someone gets your password, this is why you need to turn on two step verification.
",7
"Even though Roblox filters out content based on your child's age, kids could lie about their age, and some things may still not be age-appropriate for  a young kid.
",1
"The games are fun and all, but a lot of kids get access to games that are not age-appropriate because of the violence, jump scares, weapon activity, and other things that get young kids in the mindset that this violence and activity is normal, and this mindset can become a normality for them.
",5
"Roblox has a filter where if you curse, hashtags appear so the ""F"" word would be ####.
",1
"If your child gets bullied or is in danger, always report with the in-game feature or grab the username and email it so Roblox for investigation.
",5
"i can recall playing on this platform since 2012, most games are good, its  merely bias and perspective that makes  people hate specific games on the platfom.
",2
"if you decide to look into roblox youtube, you'll maybe  encounter a video titled ""the TRUTH about online dating on roblox"", this WILL scare you into thinking your kid will begin to OD on roblox, however, unless your kid specifically searches for roleplay games that aren't even meant for ODing, then he/she should be fine

"Filter: roblox one day had a panic attack because everyone hated them over some people talking about how you can say your address and crap so I hope you didn’t like saying words like cell phone or house or just numbers.

"The problem is, the users there sometimes bully you.
",1
"For example, I was playing a game with my friend and someone called my friend a ""noob""  and said ""ur so poor"" just because he was wearing free items from the catalog.

"Also the community can also be toxic sometimes.

"Roblox used to be this quite simple game with simple minigames, like Super Bomb Survival or Work at a pizza place, but those days are long gone,  now all you have on the surface are role playing games in which there are a lot of inappropriate behavior and sometimes even harassment, ""Scary"" games that are nothing but a clone of each other and simulators, which I don't find a real problem I just find them lacking originality, but this only applies to some.

"Parents complain about pricing, which that's when they get bad reviews.

"Roblox has too much violence.
",2
"For parents I would not recomend games Like Murder Mystry 2 or PIGGY.
",5
"For those who think it's bad 
",2
"It's not yeah sure there may be bad stuff BUT HEY CHECK THIS OUT its a secret that apparently nobody knows it's called a report button so you see here you press it and find your reason so yeah 2.
",7
"How can ppl say bad stuff when there's ""#######"" yeah that's there too 4 .
",1
"The violence is not bad, you can use rockets/bombs/paintball guns/bouncy balls/sling shots/and many other things.
",1
"This is not bloody.
",3
"Sometimes there is blood on walls, but that's only at like a zombie game or something.
",3
"There is a 1 in a thousand change that you will find a game where someone cusses.
",6
"If you did something stupid people would call you a noob.
",4
"Although there are some bullies and there is guns you can turn on a feature that allows you to not talk or see message and does not let you play violent games.
",7
"parents, this game is safe for all the childrens and i saw some reviews saying that this game is evil like what is evil in a kids game other reviews  saying too much swearing, swearing its common but these parents dont understand that this is the internet everybody swears on internet and the chat tags block the swear words
",2
"Avid roblox player here, the news doesn't make ROBLOX out to what it is.
",2
"They say that roblox is a sexual game full of pedophiles, It's really not all that.
",2
"Actually, ROBLOX doesn't make these games.
",7
"If you don't want your ""Oh so sweet precious child"" exposed to gun games, turn on Restricted mode in settings.
",7
"This game does get you a lot of limitations on what you can get for a non-spending player.
",7
"Sorry for the rant, but parents really don't get everything that goes on in ROBLOX.
",6
"Some of the negative reviews are overexaggerated.
",2
"Even the people who do online date are just young kids roleplaying which causes no harm at all.
",4
"I know that there are some people with inappropriate avatars but Roblox prevents that by making you wear default clothing if your profile consists of one skin colour.
",5
"I also hear a lot of people saying that reporting doesn't work.
",2
"Roblox has a lot of players and they can't keep up with all their reports.
",9
"Also, the chat filter is so strict that you can't post street names, house addresses, phone numbers and other personal information.
",1
"There's a very low chance you will be a victim of a predator on Roblox.
",9
"There are some infamous free Robux scams that unfortunately exist on Roblox but Roblox can't do anything about it because there are so many bots that spam free-Robux that the moderators can't keep up with all the reports.
",8
"If a game asks for your password, it's a certain scam and you should report it.
",7
"I do have to admit that there are toxic players on roblox.
",1
"Aside from the negative factors of Roblox.
",4
"I personally advise that you teach your child about online safety before you let them play since there are many scammers or hackers trying to take adavantage of your child.
",7
"To the karens that think that games like ""Jailbreak"" are violent, its just for fun.
",2
"Some people can toxic you can either leave the game, or just put up with it.
",7
"(I really don't advise it though) And those ""Adopt and Raise"" games, its not actual dating, it's just kids roleplaying  just imagine a little kid saying ""My wife, I met her on roblox"" Thats stupid, that would probably almost never happen.
",0
"So, A blatant statement.
",6
"If your child did something stupid, IT WAS YOUR CHILD'S FAULT NOT ROBLOX'S 
",7
"
",0
"So, overall, if you or your child stumbles on something bad, it was a it was not roblox's fault, roblox is a platform, most things are user generated.
",5
"So, That is my review I guess :/
",0
"I have to say Roblox isn't the best game.
",1
"My account was hacked and when I made a new one it was hacked too, 5 minutes later.
",0
"Roblox should start looking at the reports of bullying, scamming, etc.
",6
"If there is a game that you don't like your child playing i suggest not having them playing it instead of deleting the app all together.
",7
"A problem I have is that im addicted and I have quite a few low grades, which is all my fault.
",4
"So make sure you or your kids aren't to addicted to this game.
",7
"Not a lot of games (even most horror games) aren't that scary.
",3
"FPS(First Person Shooters): Not all of the FPS games are bad.

"Def not for a 5 year old.
",4
"Robux scams: There are games that ""claim"" to give you free Robux.
",5
"However, these are scams.
",8
"There are different types of scams, but the most popular type of scam goes like this:
",3
"A user enters an course with jumps (also called an obby).
",7
"DO NOT SHARE THOSE.
",0
"Your account will be hacked.
",5
"You will lose everything.
",6
"You may even get banned forever!
",5
"Online Daters (ODers): ODers, although have been less popular, is still a huge problem, especially if your dating someone you don't know.
",1
"Online Dating is against the Terms of Service (ToS) And you can possibly be BANNED!
",8
"If you see someone OD'ing, tell them the dangers like ""it can possibly be an old man your dating"" and ""its against the rules to date online.""
",7
"If they don't stop, just report them (people claim that they don't work, but it's the only thing to do).
",7
"Do I think Roblox is that bad, no.
",2
"All this stuff about people being traumatized from it is fake.
",6
"There is violence but no gore and the characters look like Lego people.
",3
"One problem though is that people will try to scam you however as long as your kids aren't stupid it should be fine.

"The thing is, most children already know bad language these days so roblox is a little  problem.
",6
"The thing is these days parents are Way to overprotective.
",6
"ONLINE DATERS ARE RARE.
",0
"The violence is not even blood its blocks falling apart.
",3
"Bad language?
",0
"The prices are way overpriced and me being with you 10 you have the knowledge or predators and you already have an insight to inappropriate language.
",6
"I've heard lots also complaining about violence- but it's not even violence its just some ""mini games"".
",2
"There are a lot of games with some violence, like guns, but there is no blood.
",2
"The moderation is okay but not the best.
",2
"There are a lot of exploiters, but they get banned really fast.
",2
"Many parents think extremely bad of this game.
",2
"That's because they don't know how anything works.
",7
"Noob just means your new at the game, bad at it, or acting like a new person.
",7
"But Roblox’s moderation is still as always... trash.
",1
"But I really just brushed it off and left.
",3
"Roblox can not control the players, it’s an online game.
",4
"I think Roblox would not be safe for children under 9 because they would not understand that anyone they plays Roblox could be anyone or anything, not always someone you know.
",4
"I know a lot of games are violent, but you can set a filter than blocks a lot of games that are.
",1
"Inappropriate stuff is tagged, they can't say numbers.
",1
"Money stuff- I can see that Roblox designed their game where kids will BEG for robux.
",9
"I begged too (yikes).
",3
"But it can also be risky.
",1
"If your child hasn't been properly educated on the following things, you should turn off the chat feature in your parental controls.
",7
"If they don't know the dangers of things like online dating, trolling, exploiting, cyberbullying, and pedophiles (all against Roblox's ToS), then turn off the chat feature.
",8
"Roblox chat also has a filter system which (if you are under 13 years old) turns numbers, profanity, sexual content, and other inappropriate things into hashtags (###) so other players can't see.
",1
"(Also, if you made it this far, let me tell you: the reviews that say Roblox is filled with p*rn and profanity, it's NOT.
",7
"They probably just saw some dumb news story and didn't get the full information.
",0
"A lot of parents say this game is bad but it actually depends on what your kid is playing like for example I play adopt me, royal high, high school life dorm, etc.
",3
"You just need to keep a eye as to what your kid is playing it’s not roblox’s fault at all.
",7
"So, please stop accusing roblox as it is not a bad game.
",1
"In the library sometimes there may be inappropriate content sometimes (where someone has bypassed the roblox filter).However, it’s a rare occurrence and generally it’s quite hidden from being seen immediately as you would need to look in the library images and audios to find these and as a new player or a young child you wouldn’t be able to find the ‘library’ easily.
",1
"There is violence, however it is fantasy violence, it’s violence like the ‘violence’ in minecraft, mild and harmless.
",8
"Also they're scams that will hack your account, so never put in your password if you have spent money on the game, or you spent alot of time on the game.
",6
"But this game has people that can be mean.
",2
"This game could also have child predators (which is scary), so you should basically limit on what you play.
",7
"(Well also Minecraft) All the parent's who says it is bad are full of baloney.
",2
"Lots of parents have their horrible story of things that have happened to their kid, and I feel bad for them, these things are not supposed to happen.
",9
"I have played this game for years, since I was 7 years old, and I have seen few things bad happen.
",0
"The worst I've seen is bypassing the filter and swearing.
",1
"Then again, it can depend on what your playing, you tend to find these bad things in games less popular or lower quality roleplaying games.
",8
"Those games are for like teens, not kids.
",3
"Because if your child play those games on Roblox, they will end up killing people in real life when they grow up!
",7
"Make sure they become a police and not a criminal, because you parents don't want your child to grow up and become a criminal.
",7
"ok so i have a few issues, sometimes the filter is easily bypassed, and you can see nsfw usernames??
",7
"This game is boring and it should not exist
",4
"You can't say swear words and it has got learning games like lua learing, 
",1
"what the word, word bomb the killing looks like breaking your legos
",3
"Well, it gets boring quickly, and some people can really destroy the innocence of this game.
",9
"They somehow make inappropriate usernames, they pass the chat filters and instead of it being filtered, the bad language is shown, and ODers.
",1
"I really do not recommend it if you are looking for something to stick with for a while.
",7
"On   the other hand, some of it can be fun.. but it still mostly is boring.
",1
"Overall, I say it’s a C-.
",1
"To be honest, I think some of the parents spewing angry reveiws all over this site have no idea whan on earth they are talking about.
",2
"First of all, for the people calling roblox ""violent"" and ""sexual"".
",1
"I have seen somebody complaining about there being weapons and bombs.
",3
"First of all, compared to other popular game titles, I don't see Roblox being ANYWHERE near as near as violent as titles like GTA 5, Modern Warfare etc.
",8
"For gods sake, parents, this is a game where you play as a walking character made of BLOCKS.
",6
"What you parents call bombs are just plastic looking spheres that makes your or other players characters reset back to their starting point or ""spawnpoint"" if they get too close.
",9
"What you are calling ""guns"" are low resolution textured grey tubes that eject colourful brick shaped projectiles that have the same effect as the so-called ""bombs"".
",9
"And when your character is killed, it plays a cartoonish ""oof"" sound and your character literally just falls into pieces and dissapears.
",3
"Games that do include blood use small quantities of it and are just translucent red squares.
",2
"If you are worried about your kids playing on these specific games, then you might as well watch over them and not let them play them rather than leave them to it then later blame the game for ""violence"".
",7
"I mean, who's fault is it that you let YOUR OWN CHILD on a game they are new to unsupervised?
",7
"All harmful language typed is censored out and instead comes out as hashtags that replace the original word/phrase for example ""shut up"" would look like ""#### ##"".
",1
"I also do not see why people are accusing this game for apparent drugs and alcohol, as not ONCE have I ever seen a single instance of this.
",1
"Overall a safe game for kids like me, but if your child does ever get bullied, you can get them permanently banned from all games and website if you either tap/click on their username which you can find in the top-left corner (a list of all the players in the game you are playing) or they will get at minimum a temporary ban.
",5
"Id say a 13 year old would be fine on their own on this game, but id say you should monitor your child when they play roblox because there is a plenty of violent games on roblox.
",7
"Just set your child's account where they cant message random people and there would be no problem with bulling, i mean i know all the bad reviews are from 2011-2014 when the filters weren't strict.
",1
"There are a lot of reviews saying that roblox is ""inappropriate"" its really not if you don't want your child exposed to adult content here are some tips:
",2
"
",0
"-Go to settings and turn on account restrictions 
",5
"- teach your child how to stay safe on the internet
",7
"-tell them not to believe anyone that says they'll give you robux (money in the game)
",5
"-monitor their activity
",8
"-when you create their account put their real birthday because roblox uses that to know what restrictions to put on their account
",5
"-tell them not 
",7
"OK there are sex games but they are hard to find because you gotta search up exactly probably join many games until you find one.
",1
"The chat filters can be bypassed, sometimes you cant say some stuff in a normal conversation because there chat filter is dumb but then someone bypasses it and swears.
",1
"I have an example se x bruh why is this not censored but numbers are??
",5
"Roblox is not that game you think children are being stalked and stuff if they are then they are stupid.
",3
"Most games on here are just bad.
",2
"They are low quality and just not fun.
",4
"You just don't do it in real life!
",7
"I think the bad community does kind of ruin Roblox.
",2
"It's full of loud and obnoxious children.
",0
"The bad language is something I don't get all the fear mongering over.
",9
"They're just words on a screen,  no need to be a Karen because someone said a word on the computer.
",1
"If your kid is moaning at you because someone called them 'noob', don't be an entitled parent and review bomb them, as this game has such quality to it that you're unjustly driving away.
",7
"Of course the community's not ideal.
",8
"If your kid gets bullied, just have them block said user(s), or better yet, just leave the server.
",7
"If your kid doesn't like one game, there's 50 million more.
",0
"If Roblox can seem greedy, remember, it's a company.
",2
"This is coming from a veteran of over eight years, not the clickbait you read in the news.
",6
"If they went missing, it's your fault for being irresponsible and entitled, like 90% of the reviews on this page.
",5
"No online game is perfect so being angry at roblox is to no use, Roblox does everything in there power to help but its not there job to babysit your kids.
",6
"Yes it CAN be violent !
",3
"*TIP FOR KIDS* if your playing a game and your bored of it or you are getting bullied or something like that SIMPLE LEAVE THAT GAME OR SERVER AND PLAY SOMETHING ELSE!
",7
"*TIPS FOR PARENTS * if you don’t agree with the things in Roblox SIMPLE TOO!
",8
"And if there is ever any inappropriate content it is usually banned quickly.
",2
"But there are also some community drama and just some games that are bad.
",2
"I think that roblox should start from the age of 12 because if a player wants to make a game then he could make it violence related.
",7
"It is an okay game, but there are a few things that are not too good...
",3
"First off, it's IMPOSSIBLE to buy anything in game without spending real money to purchase ""Robux.""
",6
"The chat filters are not very good, so people often curse or just do innapropriate stuff!
",1
"The animation is bad, games confusing, very laggy.
",3
"I've been playing roblox ever since 2017 and here;s what i've found: Some violent games such as Camping and Piggy may not be suitable for children under thirteen years of age.
",1
"Mild profanity, games like Rap Battles where people roast each other, and there are cyberbullies.
",2
"Like when this person came into dance off and started to bully us.
",0
"Some people think reporting does not work but it does, you report somebody, it gets viewed by a admin and they will review the chat.
",2
"If they reviewed the chat and it was true fifteen times, your account will be banned.
",9
"Minor criticism i think having limited amount of friends and removing the best friends feature is a not so great feature.
",1
"One of the problems in Roblox is the fact that there is hackers and people using numbers to swear.
",1
"Also ROBLOX mods will do anything to protect your child from not letting them see certain links to not letting them say numbers or bad works due to safe chat.
",7
"Roblox is a dangerous place.
",2
"There are plenty of scammers and exploiters out there who could potentially take your money and/or private information.
",8
"There are stories in the news like,""An 8-year-old daughter being raped in a Roblox game"" or ""9-year-old starts using third-party website because of Roblox.""
",2
"To me, it just seems like irresponsible parenting and baseless complaints.
",5
"Roblox is a game, not a babysitter.
",3
"So overall, Roblox can be a scary place.
",3
"Never play these games any role play game, vibe games, and games that have “baby” in them.
",3
"There are people called scammers never trade anyone but trusted people.
",5
"Bullies are on Roblox to just walk away and report easy I recommend people over 9 can chat to strangers but always keep your information to yourself.
",7
"In trading, you can get scammed very easily if you aren't careful.
",7
"The graphics arent anything special but graphics doesnt matter with eighter its  a good or bad game.
",3
"I think its stupid when someone forgets  there password and they go complaining to Roblox even tho its there own fault.
",8
"If you dont want to get your account hacked than dont go to scam games ( wich there isnt many cuz Roblox is delleting them) nor go to scam websites that scam bots are promoting.
",6
"If someone is making fun of you and you dont like it than just block them so you wont see their mesagges.
",7
"But there can be some bad parts for you or your child.
",3
"Like there is people who can download hacks and put inappropriate stuff in the game.
",1
"And there is also hackers that can hack into your Childs account with often leads to tears.
",5
"If you say no if often leads to tears.
",4
"But if you say yes and let them use your credit/debit card then you might get lots of more spam calls and random text messages.
",7
"Roblox is a free to play game where you can have in-game purchases which I do not recommend unless your child has earned it.
",7
"If your child is developing unnatural behaviours or spending money without your approval OR their grades are dropping, try and have a chat with them, to try and encourage them to stop and tell them the dangers.
",7
"If they are being reckless, then you should limit their time because if you don’t let them play, they may be sad and be infuriated.
",7
"If your child has somehow hacked your account and is spending money, stop them, contact the bank, and get a more secure password.
",9
"If your child is sneaking and playing games secretly and you don’t want them to, use parental controls to disable access to the game.
",5
"This game may seem horrible, but is actually just mildly hard parkour, and can teach you patience.
",5
"That’s the end!
",1
"Y'all are stupid.
",2
"Innapropriate games?
",0
"Just stop your kid from playing them.
",7
"Don't give your child unlimited access to your credit card, this isn't Fortnite.
",7
"Violence is in the game, and can be found in most of the games, but this is just part of most video games unfortunately.
",2
"If you don't like it go play Bob the Builder with your child or maybe just stop being a strict parent.
",7
"It's also important to note that accounts do get hacked and scammed often, that's also something that can't be avoided.
",5
"There is some violence, bad games, but it's not roblox's fault.
",2
"If you have a problem with that, i recommend you tell your child while making an account, that they should put that they are under 13, since it filters other considered ""mean"" words like: stupid, ugly, dumb etc..
",7
"If you don't want your child to see that, tell them to make their account under 13.
",7
"Talking about it, the website responses are terrible and always have a downtime, a website that runs on 20$ a month can do better than a billion dollar company.
",9
"Although there are many good games on ROBLOX and you could learn something from it, through my experience over the past 5 years, I find it terrible for users in general and myself, I hope this review help you reconsider on letting your child play the games there and keeping them safe from all unsafe content.
",4
"8 year olds are accually smart enough to not fall for free robux scams.
",8
"language you can say hell just hell and damn.
",3
"Parents usually use thier thinking only.If they play first game and that game is bad they will think roblox is bad.
",7
"I know thier are some bully.I think if someone bully you and say you are noob you just prove to him that you were not a noob .Parent use thier thinking as a main.I think roblox is simmilar to youtube.

"youtube have some bad thing such as, naked people and many other thing.
",1
"My uncle not let me play first person shooter game because he think in the future I will be criminal and shoot other people.
",0
"I think its dumb.
",2
"Roblox is a game that was released in 2006, it came 3 years before Minecraft, if your kids say it is like Minecraft, then their idiots, anyways on to the review!
",0
"There are Online Daters (also known as ODers), condo games (witch 99.9% of them are gross sex games) and bypassed assets, lucky, the moderation bots will delete them after like 30 minutes or something.
",8
"There are also free robux games, most of them are obbies, but they don't give free robux, they try to trick you into handing over your account.
",5
"I don't know, but I sure know how greedy the people at Roblox HQ are.
",7
"However there is a necessary evil at play, kid's want to be free and after 9 PM moderators get off their shifts... so-called ""condo games"" go up filled with horny little boys who start raping each other, these games also remove the filter allowing everybody to say anything.
",6
"This is an extreme example thought, its a necessary evil, without it it'd be another boring kids game that looks like its trying to hard to not confuse a 2 year old.
",4
"If that's not worth it I don't know what is.
",6
"Most kids don't even know this evil exists.
",7
"There is rarely any violence and the graphics are cartoonish.
",3
"You can also block players who you think are bad.
",7
"People think that there is tons of NFSW, and violence, but not really.
",2
"If these are found, you can report people to roblox, and they will most likely be banned.
",7
"Gladly it didnt work but maybe kids that are 6 might think everyone is friendly on the internet.
",2
"So this game might have some people who bypass the filter, Online date, scam, etc.
",1
"Just be safe
",7
"Also dont expect a massive company with not even 1000 employes ""at time of writing"" to deal with the 64 million monthly players perfectly
",3
"There are ""bot"" or accounts managed by robots that simply copy-paste a message onto the private chat feature and hope that you click.
",1
"This is not true.
",3
"In my experience, it's almost TOO well monitored.

"You were unable to say numbers until a recent update, you are unable to say bad words, even those with modified spellings and the worst thing a player can do is say ,""NOOB!""

"scamming is just something you’re either going to be sane enough to avoid or be stupid enough to fall for.

"I don’t know why people say it is 18+ becuase the chat filter is so strong you can barley say anything and everything you post has to be viewed by a moderator before it is posted.
",1
"The only problem I think is that there are scammers And exploiters on roblox but besides them I would give this a 5 star rating and is appropriate for kids 7 or over
",6
"The game itself is built like it was meant to be played by anyone, but the lack of moderation means a lot of pedos, people bypassing the swear filters, exploiters in games, exploiters using 18+ scripts, blood and gore games, I'd say 13+ because that seems to be the age of users who are on it a lot.

"People also say that this game is expensive which isn’t true, the game is free but has IAP(in app purchase)  And if your kids see a bully in the game and they bully them then tell them to block or ignore the bullies or you can just tell them to report the bullies

",8
"They also can ban ppl for like no reason at all which sucks!
",6
"Another thing is that bad language gets censored and will come up as hashtags, so there is little to no bad language in Roblox.
",1
"If you don’t want to chat with other players then there is a feature that makes it so you can’t.

"The game ends when the murderer kills everyone, the murderer leaves the game, or the sheriff/hero shoots the murderer (again, the shooting is not graphic, the murderer just falls to the ground with no blood, just a gunshot sound effect).

"When you die (such as falling or getting killed in the game) or reset, you either get a screen with the border line briefly glowing red (meaning you died) or your body parts such as limbs, heads, arms , legs get dismembered and fall apart like a toy (not graphic).

"Both age ranges have  profane language blocked as hashtags (#), but, again, you can never be sure of that.
",1
"This is a little bit inaccurate, due to the ESRB only reviewing some samples of the games selected.

"And I normally see popular games like MM2/3 JailBreak, and MadCity and these games will contain things such as Violence,  3Rd Degree murder and a lot more things.

"The game i'd would not play is Adopt me, Adopt And Raise A Cute Baby Those games contain this: Sex, Nudity, Foul language, and Online dating wich is violating roblox terms of use and privacy policy on rule 8 it says: As a social platform for play, Roblox tries to provide a safe place to meet on-line friends, play, chat, and collaborate on creative projects.
",2
"However, this is not the place to look for dating partners.

"The roblox filter is so strict that swearing is pretty much impossible.

"The report barely does anything due to you know, roblox having 1 billion users and its hard to keep up with all these reports, but none of my reports have worked.
",2
"The drama is just too much man sometimes.
",2
"And by the way, the parents who make these 1 star reviews are just lazy moms who have only seen the bad side of roblox.
",2
"The chat filter can suck, but its hard to swear.
",1
"Roblox has been a game for kids from 2004 and I think parents should literally wise up.
",4
"It's hard to control over 1 billion users and just yeah.
",2
"Good game, but some problems.
",2
"I am not going to address the sex issue.
",0
"It's not roblox's fault.
",7
"And the violence, well that depends.
",1
"Thats also sadly one of the cons.
",1
"Sure, some people will be jerks and try to hack your account or take advantage of little kids, but you'll find that everywhere.
",8
"The violent ganes arent the developers faults, its the people who made them.
",3
"Theres bad users I every game, you cant deny it.
",2
"However, people will make fun of kids because they dont have Robux, the currency of Roblox.
",4
"Wasting money on digital cosmetics doesn't mske you cool.
",6
"It makes you poor and stupid.
",9
"So the only way to find one is either being associated with people who make those kind of games or you decided to join your friend and they were playing an inappropriate game so its not very likely that your child will find a game like it.And if you dont want your child playing this thats fine but its really not that bad there is a lot of fun games on there and even the ones that have guns like phantom forces
",7
"Stop going on about how roblox isn’t safe.
",7
"You can’t even say numbers, say the word noob, say password, etc.
",1
"Also stop making fake children accounts rambling on about how roblox has nudity.
",6
"One fake account said that they were threatened to be killed, get told they would be stabbed and shot.

"Lies.
",0
"That's the part you need to be careful: your kids may find some really violent or unsuitable-for-kids games.
",7
"It's not the best but not the worst videogame.
",1
"Your child will get bullied, blackmailed and annoyed on purpose.
",0
"Loads of inapporiate games and usernames on there.

"Roblox take no notice of any reports, frankly I don't think they care.
",4
"I was called 'a stupid spoiled brat' and an 'idiot' countless times for minding my own business.

"It's not a good game, it's pay to win and it's boring.

"All of the good stuff is for robux, and that sucks.
",2
"I do not recommend this game.
",4
"And you can't delete your account, and there are a lot of hackers.
",3
"Just do NOT play this.
",7
"It's NOT crative, and there are games that are NOT GOOD.
",8
"You pay for boost that players without Robux can't get.
",1
"The chat is often violent.
",1
"There's a lot of scammers, that can take your Robux, items or even hack your account.
",7
"Plus, the game your child plays is probably some crap someone made up in an hour, and stuffed it with in-game purchases.
",3
"I do not recommend you let your child play this game.
",7
"Roblox is a multi-platform game, so there will be a lot of games, and inside those game there will be some bad games, but... Is it Roblox's Fault?
",2
"You'd have to do so much thing, and the result you'd get tired doing it, and the result won't actually be perfect!
",2
"And about Cyberbullying, online dating, and bypassing, remember, it's not like everything is perfect, in a whole community there will always be at least ONE BAD PERSON, just think, do you have a bad habit?
",2
"And for the last thing, Violence on Roblox.
",0
"It's just like Lego, it's just like a Lego body falling apart!
",3
"I hope parents before Throwing out a hate message, please take what I wrote into your consideration.
",7
"Is ROBLOX that bad?
",8
"Also if your kid is hacked, it's your fault not Roblox's
",7
"It does have hackers but Roblox will ban them.
",1
"Roblox also tags out weird words like address.
",1
"It doesn't let you say numbers and more.. You also can't this word ""password"".
",1
"There are more scammers but mostly kids just play their games.
",8
"So I think, Roblox can be a fun game and all but there are some drawbacks:
",2
"
",0
"1) Consumerism
",0
"This happens a lot in the game when people who have a cool game pass or cosmetics go around showing off too kids who don't have them.
",6
"It can suck kids in, and they never get out.
",7
"His mom even had to pay me to help him with the addiction.
",0
"I tried but nothing worked.
",6
"2) Bots and Phishers
",0
"Okay now and then I see these accounts but Roblox has really cracked down and got rid of them.
",8
"Sometimes they can be scary or have too much violence.
",3
"However, a lego dying is not violent.
",2
"Also if you say there not aloud to play and they get on it;  whip their ass!
",7
"It has some swearing in the hat but its not the games fault,  people know how to get past the filter.
",1
"The game has some inappropriate stuff in the game ROBLOX, theres this one game called *send_cons* They get deleted really quick in like 10 minutes, For kids, the platform is safe, Like.
",2
"Numbers are blocked due people keep giving phone numbers which is bad.
",1
"So, roblox deletes any numbers, bad words, and many more.
",2
"No need to be rude to your child if something weird/bad happens.
",7
"My friend got banned for saying ""go away man"", but literally 50% of people ares super toxic to other players and call people shit, fuck, and crap.
",2
"Why ban for saying ""go away man"" instead of being banned for saying swears, once you become toxic like them, there is no turning back, also there is a lot of people who think they are better then anyone, they say stuff like, OMG U SO FUKING SHIT HAHA NOOOOOOOB!!!!!!
",2
"LOL I'M BETTER THAN U, TRASH and OMG L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L  L L L L L , it always happens E V E R Y W H E R E, even if you die from someone in the game, everyone would call u mean names, they mainly target nice people and people who are new to roblox, so yeah, only play this is you can handle the stuff I said above.
",2
"I would give the violence 4/5 because most of the violence isn't gory but in some games blood can splatter on the screen.
",8
"Sometimes very inappropriate
",1
"Aside from the few inappropriate games you could find, there was an issue of bullying.
",8
"Some players would call other players ""noobs"" or ""bacon hair"" just because they didn't have the in game currency called ""Robux"".
",4
"That is really fake!
",2
"they will delete your account on ROBLOX
",5
"The violence isn’t like in real life and more cartoon-y.
",8
"The blood is really just red plastic circles and most ‘violent games’ don’t even hold them.
",3
"If you see anything weird like a hacker or troll you can use report abuse.
",7
"If the person, game or group doesn’t get banned, it’s either they didn’t see your report (they only have 70-100 admins) or, they did get banned temporarily.
",5
"If somebody has said something that is inappropriate or offensive or hurt your feelings, most of the time it will be moderated and if it isn't, you can report them.
",1
"If somebody made a game that is inappropriate or offensive, you can report that game, too.
",1
"And for parents who say it's ""inappropiate"" I can agree, but at the same time it's the internet.
",2
"They have other things to do as well...And, if you don't like what you see on roblox, then just LOG OUT.
",7
"Oh yeah, and about the swearing thing, it's not just roblox.
",1
"But if you're still uncomfortable with it, you could always just close the chat or LOG OUT AND SHUT THE LAPTOP.
",7
"Even If Some Idiot Creates Something Bad (Which Never Happens) Roblox Will Block It and replace the name and description with “[Content Deleted]” and replace the map with a starter place.
",1
"And, If someone tries to swear, it will be replaced with hashtags.
",1
"Parents think of the game as ""dangerous"".
",2
"They don't understand the platform is community driven.
",2
"Chats can be pretty toxic at times, but if you find the right community, you are pretty much safe until trolls and bad people find their way in.
",2
"I’m tired of parents saying “Roblox” is a game full of innapropriate stuff , it’s really annoying.
",2
"The parents think roblox is just a game full of violence.
",2
"Also, if they’re child sees them online dating , they would just report on them and leave or never play that game again ( Roblox has multiple games in it) SEE, it’s simple to ignore that stuff.
",7
"When I view the parents reviews on roblox , they say they’re child’s account was hacked and showed the email .
",0
"Mostly when parents get a email from roblox thinking that they’re child got hacked , They would just tell them to quit .
",5
"Also , most parents say no whenever kids asked them for robux .
",5
"It’s cause they think roblox is scamming for money which means they don’t even understand They can have robux or don’t need robux it’s not a scam.
",6
"They don’t understand what’s the difference betweeen they play .
",4
"Finally, the blood on roblox is not real , when you stab in this game called Murder Mystery 2 , it doesn’t show blood .
",3
"Omg , it’s so annoying when the parents when they like shoot or stab in the game , they’re just gonna tell you to quit cause they think it shows blood.Also, have fun with your child playing roblox I say you should play cause it’s the best.
",7
"Now I haven't played this game a lot (only when I was younger) but there are still inappropriate and horrid games.
",1
"I'm not sure why people do this but they do and there are lots of it.
",7
"This shouldn't exist but it does, you just have to deal with it.
",3
"Luckily games like these can be avoided.
",3
"A big problem with Roblox however, is the usage of ads.
",8
"And there are an unbelievable amount of ads.
",7
"Some are even poorly made sponsorships or nonsensical images.
",1
"You can purchase cosmetics, subscriptions, access to certain games (good games), and more
",5
"The problem with this is that items are often over priced to a ridiculous amount.
",2
"Some people decide to hack the game (happens quite to often) for Robux, trolling, griefing, and scaring other players.
",4
"The game is extremely unpolished as well, with updates practically every week just for bug fixes.
",0
"In the mood of committing crimes?
",8
"There are it's problems.
",2
"You should teach your child the importance of money so they do not go and hit ""Buy 10,000 Robux"" (the in-game currency) there are also many scams like put your password here and get FREE ROBUX so teach your child to not fall for these.
",7
"Yes, there's exploiters that do scripts that are inappropriate and erping.
",2
"Yes there's free roux scams.
",3
"There are issues with the moderation though.
",1
"Everyone is going to be exposed to unclean things in life anyways sadly.
",1
"However they allow these two words Hell, and Damn.
",1
"Any other words will be bleeped out.
",1
"Just make sure your child isnt a dumbass like most of the adults here and your free to go, just let them do whatever you want, your a bad parent
",7
"If you have worries about the game just monitor your child, ROBLOX usually never has cuss words, it’s just that one edgy 13 year old thinking they’re funny.
",5
"Just never go to a cafe game, lots of trolls and swearing, they bypass the chat filter, if you’re wondering, ROBUX is the currency for ROBLOX and it can be a bit expensive, but I understand that how the company makes a profit.

"It is geared towards children, and innapropriate content is constantly removed and very quickly at that.

"If you see something you don't like, you can report it, block, and/or mute the person making them silent in games.
",7
"People can't swear or say bad words.

"Those words are replaced with ##### to censor it.

"PS: This game was even banned in the U.A.E because of nasty stuff, look it up on Wikipedia.

"SERIOUSLY you parents think it's 18+ what the heck it's literally for any age 4+ AND I DONT CARE WHAT YOU PARENTS SAY my lil bro plays it all the time with me and I'm straight As and he's A quality it doesn't effect us in any way INFACT it makes us better and I literally just read something a parent said and it disgusted me they said ""And I saw my kid drinking something called 'water' is that some kind of beer or something?""
",0
"LIKE IM JUST DISCUSTED BY THEYRE STUPIDITY AND THEY EVEN WENT FURTHER TO SAY: ""what is this game doing to my kid its making them dumb"" I think that's just genes you idiot now the worst part was this ""MY KID IS ACTUALLY SOCILIZING WITH PEOPLE IM GONNA TAKE THIS OFF THEM FOR GOOD"" I'm just discusted 
",2
"
",0
"Anyway ROBLOX is an amazing game there is no blood and if there is it's hardly anything and the death animation is just LEGO men falling apart minecraft's is worse you literally turn red and fall on the ground 
",3
"
",0
"Like, LOADS of them.
",2
"It has many genres so there is horror games as well as some crime references
",3
"The fact that you play with other online platers can be a little bit bad because it could lead to cyber-bullying
",8
"i think it should be 13 cause some of the games on there are brudel like saw trial clarity and some people that are in that game say very bad words in the chat
",1
"Don't listen to these parents who think roblox is equivalent to the dark web.
",7
"There are some in-app purchases, but if your kids buy them without your permission, you can contact roblox and they will ban them.
",7
"Talking of moderation, I'd rate it quite poor since the team barely accepts reports and they don't bother about scam bots etc.
",6
"Plus, they did things most people disliked.
",1
"Well, how would you tolerate people being forced to wear something that looks ugly?!
",1
"It was THAT bad.
",0
"I feel like roblox gets a lot of negative attention in the media, and may I mention, all of the negative attention it gets is false.
",3
"So let me break down all of the negative stereotypes about roblox:
",4
"
",0
"1 - Violence
",0
"Violence is not a problem on roblox.
",2
"Most games have little to no violence (the ones that have a little bit aren't even that bad, it's literally just lego people hitting each other with unrealistic weapons.
",8
"Now, there are some games that do have violence, like Arsenal, Phantom Forces, and other shooter games.
",3
"Doesn't every website in existence have pedos?
",6
"And no, I'm not being dismissive towards pedophilia, but come on, it's not even a huge problem on roblox, it's only when kids go to off-site websites, such as Discord.
",8
"The chat won't let you cuss or say words that they haven't put on their list, it""s pretty annoying when i'm trying to say something and its just scratching out what i'm saying because i misspelled a word.
",1
"Hackers, i have never seen a hacker in years, and i've tried to hack a few times, but ive never gotten it to work: they just do such a good job patching all of it.
",6
"Nothing bad but there may be blood in some games and your child might see someone in the chat say hell or gay but you can REPORT them if there being mean!
",3
"And if your kids being bullied all the time then just change the AGE settings so your kids in bubble chat and words like hell and gay are blocked off!
",7
"That still doesn't mean it's bad.
",1
"They have censored chat so you cannot curse.
",1
"There are some bad games like ""CNP Hangout"".
",3
"There are also a  lot of edgy people but you can just turn off chat.
",2
"Most of the games are relationship-oriented, making the game less fun for kids.
",2
"Lots of ODing, and the games are bland at times.
",9
"The YouTubers that make videos off ROBLOX (Such as InquisitorMaster) do lots of ODing, and are a very bad influence.
",8
"They usually buy lots of Robux, customize their characters with expensive accessories, scream, play violent games, and often talk about relationships.
",4
"There ARE guns but I don't think that apply to Violence well, I mean yes it is killing someone but it is not that bad there is not blood and realistic deaths or anything, so I think it's pretty good.
",3
"One downside is that if your child wants their avatar to ""Look Gangster"" , you have to splash out real money for it's in-game currency.
",7
"So, my top favorite game is Roblox, and it’s 12+, so, I was kinda disappointed about that.
",0
"Many complaints are about scamming and hacking, and yeah.
",2
"Violence is a problem BUT NOT INTENSE AT ALL!
",2
"Violence has swords, guns, NO BLOOD, and when avatars die, they fall apart.
",3
"ROBLOX CARES MORE ABOUT MONEY THAN THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.
",0
"My Roblox account recently got hacked, and the hacker uploaded inappropriate pictures to it (decals) so I got banned and the Customer Service COULDN'T give a damn.
",0
"Don't waste money on this game because your account may get hacked, Roblox Customer Service will just copy and paste a message saying ""oh sorry lol it's all your fault and not our problem lol"", and you're literally stuck with nothing.
",9
"All Roblox wants is the money and doesn't care about their users.
",6
"Also, there's this dumb currency called Robux, it's way too expensive, and you can only buy it from them.
",6
"Roblox, as someone else said, is very greedy, and as a company that has over 3 million dollars, they don't need Robux anymore, but now they're charging more than ever for Robux.
",6
"It's really unfair how people with poorer families can do less than those who have more money to waste on Robux.
",6
"If you buy Robux and they ban you for no valid reason (kind of like what they did with me), they're basically stealing your money and that can be considered theft.
",6
"Well, basically what I'm saying is, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH ROBLOX, YOU'LL PROBABLY GET HACKED, THE CUSTOMER CARE WILL BLAME IT ALL ON YOU, AND YOU LOSE EVERYTHING.
",7
"There are many immature people who are willing to test your child's nerves just for views on Youtube or plain fun.
",6
"Tell them that fighting back will NEVER help a situation online.
",7
"I also want to warn you that people may become bullied because they are a 'noob'.
",7
"So I started to play roblox in 2016, when the ice arms and legs were a trend (still is), I got ""bullied"" for being a ""noob"" because I had no robux.
",7
"People can be inappropriate but you can block them by going to their profil.
",7
"Just stay away from the roplaying games.

"There are hackers in the games, but they are just some kids that were dropped as a baby.

"I hope I dont have to get back on here a give it a lower rating.

"There are some games that are good, meh, and a disgrace to this ""child friendly game"" and i'm talking about those.

"Some games have you have big breasts or stuff, or a dude who kills other dudes with a knife or a machine gun.
",1
"And a game with police brutality called ""Jailbreak"".

"Don't let them play this

"However, roblox cracks down on these people that are posting unwanted content.
",5
"These games were the lead point of the bad people on roblox, where roblox e-sex would happen, and people just using bad words left and right.
",1
"They will usually get deleted within 15-30 minutes of release.
",6
"I said early, there is a ""Dark side"" of roblox.
",2
"I've seen many things in the dark side of roblox, mainly due to errors in the roblox automatic moderation system.
",1
"If kids find something like a pornographic image, it is most likely a hacker, or a decal that the creators use special tactics to make it where roblox cannot see what is the bypass of the filter in it.
",1
"The only way your kid is going to get exposed to pornographic content on roblox, is if they were searching for it, or if a hacker had done that.
",6
"I would recommend not giving your kid robux, and if you do make them do something to earn it.
",7
"Lots of robux for nothing, can cause your kid to get addicted to spending on roblox, and they will bug you for money.
",7
"If you say that, 'there is to much cursing on roblox!'
",1
"that cannot really mean much, because all kids are going to get exposed to swear words at one point in their life (5th grade and up mostly.)
",1
"so you shouldn't worry  about them learning about curse words on roblox.
",7
"It’s is not the developer’s fault that your kid saw something 18+.
",7
"In fact, it’s YOUR fault for not monitoring what your kids do and see.
",7
"If One Of Your Children Gets Bullied On Roblox, They Can Just Click On Their Username n The Player List And Press ""Report"".

"if your family thinks falling apart Lego bricks is violent then you might as well stop playing all video games because I bet Mario is to violent for your kid too.

"all the bad reviews were either made when Roblox was a small game with little moderation or fake lying comments.
",9
"all the games and chats are moderated and you can not send pictures through them, swearing is not allowed and gets censored.
",1
"there is no blood and you just fall apart into a bunch of pieces and if thats to scary for your kid then boohoo NOBODY CARES.
",3
"btw I have no idea why my reviews go to the parent section.
",4
"I've read enough ""bad"" reviews about this game.
",2
"Some say that it should be banned because their 6-8 year old kid was being exposed to stuff.

"They are the ones that bought a preteen game for a little kid.

"Meep city has been hacked 3 times (Of my knowing) and they should get better security.

"disgusting game,so m8uch swearing,bullying and violence yeah kids should play it
",3
"
",0
"(gta5,cod or csgo is even safer)
",2
"And I feel like the restrictions are terrible because once I went into a game and I was playing it and there was a grey screen and then it just started saying curse words in the intro.
",0
"There were also some killer games that I really don’t like because they make me really uncomfortable.
",3
"The killers have really scary faces and you have to survive.
",7
"There are also really frightening songs in the background.
",3
"There are people who choose to do nasty things on this game like, drawing anime p•rn or making s•x games.
",2
"So, In my honest opinion you need to explain to your children what these things are.
",7
"I'd like to say in advance that I didn't rate this a full 6 because there are some mean users and some bad games that may portray violence or some inappropriate acts.
",3
"I think the reason most parents are rating this game badly is because their children are misinforming them, or not passing information through clearly.
",7
"If you're child is being treated poorly in-game, please remember that this is the internet and you can block users.
",7
"It also makes it much more difficult for hackers to try and hack your child's account.
",8
"Before I go any farther, I would like to tell you that the in-game reporting system gets far too many fake reports and so has stopped working a few years ago.
",2
"A lot of games have disabled chat, and the chat also automatically turns swear words such as f*ck, sh*t or b*tch into hashtags.
",1
"This may lead to confusion or your kids getting upset, but always remember you can join a new server or block the mean user in question.
",7
"If you don't want this to happen, you can disable it in the Settings menu or prevent your child from adding or accepting friends in the first place.
",5
"And reading the reviews, I've noticed that a lot of parents have said ""Roblox is teaching my kid bad things, such as drinking or improper math"".
",6
"Teach them common sense before you let them play.
",7
"Inform them that even though your avatar may smoke or drink and even kill in some games, it is NEVER okay to do in real life.
",5
"This is why I say set a time limit, or else this may be the first stepping stone to addiction.
",5
"Even you parents will know this, because it happens every day.
",7
"If we don't have a device to play on, we can't do anything.
",6
"Hide it or something.

"Video games dont cause violence and people fighting in the chat are often dumb 10 year olds.

"Roblox terminates oder accounts not all people on roblox are online daters and i have barely come across any.
",3
"Most people are nice and helpful and i really dont believe you found stuff like this so stop fucking lying.
",6
"also noob is a joke not something to try to be mean, get over it.
",9
"This is where my disagreement with this game starts.
",2
"ROBLOX does cost a lot of money to actually purchase perks like character decorations and whatnot.
",8
"Although this game may seem cartoony and nice, I am a kid myself, and the amount of online dating and bad stuff happening in this game that it makes me want to quit and find another addictive game.
",2
"Meepcity is the target for seductive communication and several kidnapping including old pedophiles and young kids that play the game.
",4
"A lot of people are targets of pedophiles and this is wrong.

"What did a game for kids ever do to deserve this?
",6
"Also, the usernames on this game CAN, not always, CAN be dirty.
",8
"This game is really disappointing because of these reasons I have listed.
",8
"This leaves this review with 13+ players and it is disappointing.
",6
"Yes these actually exist, and they are disgusting.
",2
"Some players on roblox are very dirty minded and vulgar while others are intellects, there are many different robloxians.

"Roblox did inspire me to program and I will always thank roblox but it wasted a lot of my time which I will never get back.

"some games get hacked sometimes and sometime the hackers put porn but it is deleted straight away.

"Stop overreacting lol.

"Fortnite has more Violence/Sex etc.
",9
"But if SOME games have blood & violence, it doesn’t mean that the game is inappropriate.
",3
"It is always great to check on your kids that they are not doing anything bad, but if they play a game with something not for kids (Blood or violence) it doesn’t mean that you need to lock down the game for your kids.

"I know cyberbullying is a bad thing, do you parents know that there is a option to make the chat not visible.

"Someone hacked my account and now won’t let me go back in it had lots of robust and more special things to me and now that person who hacked it deleted my account and I want roblox to login into it and find the bug so I can change my password?,thank you I’m begging you
",0
"There are many parents complaining that their child was attacked by child predators, but even though this is a terrible thing that has happened to your kid and I'm sorry about that, you need to understand that Roblox's employees are very busy and the team is very small.
",3
"They have only 400 employees and a bunch of bots, so it is hard.
",6
"Some updates were really good ideas, some updates made players angry although it needed to be done (especially tix removal) and some were straight-up bad.
",9
"This might sound toxic, but this doesn't happen all the time, so don't worry.
",2
"People can bully each other and bypass the filters sometimes but what you should do is just report then and ignore them so Roblox moderators or bots can investigate it.
",7
"Many people say Roblox is not kid friendly, but like I said, they have some flaws and are not a perfect company.
",2
"but as a player myself, i see a lot of bullying which could be offending to younger kids.
",3
"I also see a lot of bad languages that have to do with sex and everything.
",1
"Also, I play a game where you could put your own music (murder mystery 2) and some people have a bypass to listen to audios that are HIGHLY inappropriate.
",3
"The audios talk about porn, sexual things, and just funny jokes using a lot of bad language.
",1
"But it’s definitely not for younger kids especially before the age of at least 14.
",4
"The problem is that there's pedos, exploiters, violent games (murder, robbing banks, scary games, etc.)
",3
"The problems that I've had that when I didn't know about scams, I said my password to a random guy and put my password in a free robux game and a year later my account almost got hacked.

"To all parents who think that games whit guns on Roblox are bad then think.

"If there is something wrong say “Uh oh, there’s something about your settings that isn’t right, I need to change this.” *change it* and basically just act fun and don’t make a big deal unless they are addicted to bad stuff or making bad stuff or talking to strangers.

"Honestly, I don't think Roblox is too inappropriate for kids anyways.
",2
"When I first started playing I was really bad at typing.
",0
"Also, if you think Roblox is too violent or inappropriate, it's actually not that inappropriate.
",3
"For one, if someone is swearing at you or something like that, you can click [Block User] under there names, which stops them from speaking to you.
",5
"For people that think the report systems don't work, they actually do.

"It's great, But Parents think its innapropiate, Well, It kinda is, our community is a bit wrong, but if you see your child on that game, just remove them from that game they are playing and report whoever created that innapropiate game, or even on people's usernames, there are some games called ""Condo"" That is kinda a ODER (Online Dater) Game, It has lots of swearing, so i wouldnt recommend your kid playing these, this is all i have about what i think about roblox, But, I 100% Recommend your kid playing rob
",7
"Just because your kid saw bad things its not roblox fault its the players fault i been on since 2008 and as a player i say roblox is the best game ever and people who report this as bad is just a stupid karen remember its not roblox fault its the player fault and roblox will ban the user

"I’ve NEVER EVER felt as if Roblox was un safe.

"All of these reviews saying that it has sexual content and etc is just a lie roblox insures that every kid is safe and deleats anything bad within a time.

"Roblox has Moderators the take care of reports so you don't have to worry about your kid getting bullied.

"However there is a problem called ""online dating"" these people stay in the game ""Life in paradise"" and try to get in a virtual relatonship And judging by the behavior and spelling ALmost ALL of them are young children, although you CAN buy robux if you don't want to you dont have to because every year roblox hosts events which you earn FREE items and have to spend no money.

"To all you dumb soccer moms: ROBLOX is a game platform where people make their games for others to play, if any messages or games are inappropriate they are reported and taken down.

"Any swears are filtered and I’ve only had one experience with a bad person and they were only using insults such as “you poop” ROBLOX is like youtube for video games but with a basic formatting, and censoring.

"Although there are some great things to it, there are some bad.

"If you don't turn off your chat settings there can be some weird stuff.
",7
"So, I've seen slot of adults complain about Roblox so I'm gonna respond to ever major common point with a solution
",9
"
",0
"1: ""It promotes bullying.""
",1
"Ok first of your child has probably dealt with a bully in real life before, so just because your child is behind a screen doesn't mean they're safe from bullying, heck it's even more frequent on the internet because people have a shield behind them, but it's also a whole lot easier to avoid them.
",2
"Look you should educate a child about cyberbullying first before even letting them do anything on the internet, and second Roblox has multiple features to deal with bullying such as: 1.
",8
"If you're child is in a toxic environment leave the environment just click the 3 lines on the top left of the screen and then click leave server.
",5
"Report the user.
",1
"Ok admittedly the report feature isn't the best but if your child wants to report a user to admins for severe bullying, send a report.
",7
"""There is too much swearing and it isn't censored enough.""
",1
"3: ""The clothing is too revealing""
",1
"Is this really that big of a deal, most of roblox's clothing is made by the community so I find it a bit unfair to blame it entirely on Roblox, most of this clothing cost robux anyway so u will have to spend real life money anyways to even get them, the most revealing free item is a minor crop top and if you're uncomfortable with your child wearing this clothing in Roblox tell them not to.
",6
"4: ""To much sex and NSFW""
",8
"This is a flaw with user generated content, they will always be that one creep who makes those weird kind of things, however these
",9
" games NEVER make it to the front page and Roblox is very strict on that kind of stuff and quick to ban these games so it's virtually impossible to find them unless your are specifically searching for one.
",1
"5: ""Too much consumerism""
",2
"But it doesn't even force you to buy Robux (Roblox's digital currency) and the moderators of Roblox need to get paid somehow, same with game developers on Roblox.
",9
"If your child somehow managed to spend some of your money than maybe your credit/debit card was added to the device most probably by you in the past and you forgot to remove it or to set it to require a password.
",7
"7: ""My child is too addicted/My child's grades are lowering.
",7
"""Too much violence.""
",2
"Yes some Roblox games contain violence but if you don't want them to play those games tell them not to and maybe give them a punishment if they do.

"Bee Swarm Simulator: A game where you have a swarm of bees and make honey, the most violent thing is that the bees will attack hostile animals that try to hurt you.

"And some of the parents I see here Are dumb.

",8
"Roblox is a game for kids and adults alike.Yes some people might do things that are inappropriate on roblox but these thing are quickly removed and are hard to find so if one pops up it’s your kid not roblox and mean people are banned quickly.
",2
"Also most of the inappropriate things in the chats happen in discord or other 3rd party chat apps so the thing you should get mad at is the 3rd party apps but you can make so they can’t make a discord account.
",5
"Edit: hackers in roblox are not hackers they are people who make free robuck games or videos on YouTube that will ask for your password and say that the will give you lots of robucks.
",7
"To make sure they don’t get your account don’t tell your kid the password to there account or sit down with them and talk with them about this so they won’t fall for this scams.
",7
"roblox can get rid of the game and will quickly but they can get rid of the videos on YouTube because YouTube won’t let them.
",6
"Also block offsite apps like YouTube, discord,Skype,Facebook,Twitter and other social media’s so predators can lure them off the site.
",5
"You roblox character can be edited but people say that people will bully you for having a “poor” avatar to solve this there are 3 options 1 turn off the chat 2 look and find a cool looking hat or clothing that are free 3 buy hats and/or clothing.
",1
"please just shut the fuck up its not roblox job to babysit your fucking kid on the internet.
",7
"Also some games I think should be banned like ever since pets were added to Adopt Me it’s been really easy to scam in that game.
",3
"And other games have way too advance of an avatar editor like Adopt And Raise basically in adopt and raise is an adoption game with an advance avatar editor people can use the editor to move hats around and what’s extremely common is sexual behavior like Breastfeeding and it makes me uncomfortable basically what players do to attract babies is make their Breasts look bigger and it’s nasty so I think Adopt And Raise should be banned a tip for parents is to
",3
"Keep kids away from online dating and sketchy people
",8
"ROBLOX Is NOT that inappropriate as you think, especially you, parents.
",1
"If you don't want your kids to be friending random strangers in ROBLOX, then check their friends list everyday and tell them that it is bad to talk to strangers because [state your reason].
",7
"I think families are really over reacting on how Roblox works.
",2
"Roblox isn't a terrible game that will get an angry man with a baseball bat at your house.
",3
"Players may get annoyed by it mainly because it's SOO protective.
",2
"If you don't like Roblox, or think it's just too addictive or whatever, then just uninstall it and change the password.
",6
"You can't delete your account because of course, you wouldn't want your child accidentally deleting their account and losing all of their limiteds, would you?
",7
"Reports are sometimes read, you just don't know that because you don't get alerted when the player you reported is banned.
",6
"If you don't like something you see, you can always contact roblox support.
",7
"So please, don't leave ratings saying how bad and pornographic Roblox is, because truly, it's just a game.
",4
"Your kids are going to witness curse words, aswell as pornographic images when they grow up anyways.
",8
"Your account can be hacked pretty easily if you don't have a secure password, or if you enter your account password in scam games, commonly titled as ""FREE ROBUX"" (The currency for this game).
",7
"There are also scam bots that run amok and spam links to scam sites in the chat, but the frequency of their numbers depend on the type of game you are playing.
",8
"If your account gets hacked, it is likely it will be turned into a scam bot, so make sure to set a secure password for yourself or your child.
",7
"I have also seen parents post reviews about Roblox having ""pornographic content"" on it, but it is mainly their own fault that they were careless and just let their own kid wander around freely in a place where you interact with strangers.
",9
"First of all, sure, there are bullies.
",2
"There are bullies on pretty much any platform, and in real life as well.
",8
"If anyone's hurting feelings, be grateful that report/block buttons exist in Roblox.
",6
"As long as there are people, there will always be iffy content.
",8
"Third, Roblox is not a cesspool of vulgar games.
",3
"Don't believe me?
",5
"Do you really think something called ""Bubblegum Simulator"" or ""Work at a Pizza Place"" could be disturbing?
",7
"The games you see on the front page are often not the best.
",3
"Sure, violent games exist, but if you don't want your child to venture into a game where your character can ""die"" by falling off part of an obstacle course, why not just watch them play 24/7?
",7
"Plus, I doubt they were even saying something even close to sexual.
",4
"Robux has hype, but it's not needed.
",2
"Ok for all of those boomers who hate Roblox It is not a bad game!
",2
"When they start getting bad grades don't blame the game blame yourself I'm working at Mcdonalds right near my apartment.
",7
"It could be a bug or glitch to the game.
",7
"Seeing avatars naked doesn't mean they could be predators all the time.
",4
"Or you might see censored out words in the chat.
",1
"Their not saying bad words its just that ""Roblox"" doesn't want anyone talking dirty in some code language so thats why if you set your account under 13 it censors numbers mispelled words and etc.., So I'm just saying to us kids just to not play those ""Roleplaying"" games.
",1
"In one game you can slowly rip off someone's head.
",8
"Also there is swearing in games and in chats.
",1
"Many people talk about hackers and scammers like they are the most dangerous thing on the planet when with proper safety measures they can be easily avoided.
",8
"You should never ever listen to them, just report them.
",7
"Also if your account has been hacked it could be a long and painful process to get it back.
",5
"Roblox is not appropriate for young kids(Under 10), and they can pay money for ROBUX (currency to buy cloth items).
",6
"They also can see the chat, which some bad words can be leaked through.
",1
"They also can follow scams for free ROBUX and other items, which leads to hackers hacking them.
",8
"Also, they are not mature enough to use privacy settings, and act responsibly.
",5
"PLEASE do not let your children under the age of 10 onto this gaming platform.
",4
"It ruens it for older kids knowing that you are playing with a 6 year old.
",4
"Which makes older kids dislike that platform, because Roblox has to censer numbers out of the chat, because little kids could give out phone numbers, and addresses.
",8
"DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT LET CHILDREN UNDER TEN GO ON ROBLOX!
",0
"It ruins it for other older kids!
",4
"First of all there are people saying ""I need a girl/guy"" or F*** you, Bit* or something like that.
",2
"Also if you are sensitive I do not recommend those games and battle games.
",3
"But not all people/games are bad.
",2
"In conclusion, ROBLOX is still that ""family friendly"" game most of us grew up with, just littered with online daters, scam bots, child predators, etc.
",9
"Please remember to NEVER share personal information with ANYONE online, people lie a lot more than your child/you think, so please DO NOT share personal info.
",7
"But Their is 1 Reason Why some Kids of Roblox Are bad, GIVE ME ROBUX UHDWADSGZ GIVE ME ROBUX....
",2
"It is too annoying.
",2
"It does give me a feeling that all of you guys think that this very calm game has Online dating which  is true and the moderation system is very garbage and Offensive language but I see it as nothing I could turn off the chat and go with my life.
",1
"I can go with a crap ton more but don't EVER say that it is over 18+ this (10+) is the right age.
",1
"Roblox could care less about reviews so don't even take the time to report a player.
",6
"You might have heard the story about the girl who was ""raped"" on roblox and her character was ""forced"" to do these things.
",0
"If roblox has a hard time finding these games, think of how hard it would be for an 8 year old.
",6
"However, there is a ton of trolling,  fake sex, strip clubs (on meep city), and bullying.
",3
"There is almost 0 percent chance of your kid getting involved in relationships online.
",9
"The only real threat is if your child is taken off ROBLOX and onto a private chat server, but this almost never happens and is not the fault of the game.
",5
"Many of the stories you may see on this and other sites are overly dramatic.
",8
"sure there are blood/violence but limbs can not tear apart due to it being legos.
",2
"some of the games can have guns and only they have blood.
",3
"remember parents stop blaming a game for content it dosent make and teach your kids internet safety and dont listen to other people that this game has drugs, swearing etc.

"innapropriate game instantly gets deleted and the user gets permanently banned
",5
"Roblox is good and all, but dont bother checking the games page.
",3
"The games page is full of online dating games and barely any good action games.
",3
"I don't understand why so many 18+ reviews exist.
",2
"Anybody who tries to curse, do anything inappropriate, etc, will probably get a warning, banned for a week, a month, or if they continue, deleted.
",5
"The games themselves aren't bad, but the kids who play them may try to do something... unsavory and against the rules.
",4
"Also, it's simply impossible for ROBLOX to scam you by using your credit card, because it sends an email to owner of said credit card to make sure that it's THEM using it.
",7
"Stop lying for attention.
",6
"There are slightly bloody games like Phantom Forces, so you should try to check in on your child every so often to be 100% sure your kid is following the rules.

"VIOLENCE: 3/5, some games have blood, horror, but if you check in on your kid you can easily avoid it.
",7
"INAPPROPRIATE STUFF: 1/5, some 'Online Daters' may try to do something bad via chat, but the avatars themselves don't do any animations involving that stuff.
",1
"LANGUAGE: Not present: There is no language able to be found in this platform.
",1
"You can type in words like 'hell' in its literal form and now, for some reason, 'bada--' but I'm sure ROBLOX will fix that.

"When you try to type in a swear in chat, it puts in # to censor it.

"You will be banned if you swear.

"I hope you listen to me and not those liars pretending they 'met up with a stranger on ROBLOX and that stranger tried to kill me!'
",6
"Listen I’m going to say this and it might not be nice but somebody had to say it, it is not roblox's job to babysit your child; you have to teach your child proper internet safety rules before they start to use the internet.
",7
"Just because you’re too incompetent to teach you child internet safety rules doesn’t mean you can pin the blame on roblox.

"As far as cussing and bullying goes, it happens.

"~Scamming/Spamming~

"Scammers have sadly made a rise on the Roblox platform.

"Simply ignore them, report them, or, in the case that others believe the bots, inform them that they can't get anything from the scam bots.

"If they don't believe you, telling them that their Roblox account could get hacked should scare them out of it!

"To deal with spammers, just ignore them, leave the game, don't rely on the chat box in the corner to read conversations, and simply report them.

"~""Faulty Report System""~

"Just because someone you reported doesn't get banned, doesn't mean that Roblox mods just completely ignored you.
",5
"With over 100 million players active each month, 1B+ registered users, and, I would assume, thousands of reports each day, it would be hard for mods to handle every single person who has ever been reported.

"Tell your children to avoid those games as well.

"If you or your child see one of the thing that i listed, Don't report it because reporting it won't do anything.

"It’s very good if someone is being mean to you just report them.

"DON'T GIVE YOUR KID YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER
",0
"If you DO and they spend 200$ thats your fault for giving them it in the first place.

"If they do steal your credit card you can get it figured out with the bank and you are to discipline them, and tell them thats credit card theft which is a felony which can earn them 15 years in prison.

"okay, first of all I want to say that way too many parent on here are over reacting.
",2
"Roblox does have some games that involve violence with guns but the covers and titles of the game clearly show the contents of the game so it’s your kids fault for clicking it.

"Plus in these games all that happens is ur little LEGO characters limbs falls off and make the well known oOf sound.

"In roblox games if a person tries to swear or say anything inappropriate it immediately blocks it with hashtags.

"Even though people try to replace certain letters with others it still blocks it, half the time it blocks out things that aren’t even inappropriate.

"For all the boomers out there reading the other reviews and assuming roblox is some sort of prostitution game, you're wrong.

"Roblox has an extremely strict filter which doesn't even allow under 13 players to say numbers.

"Do not follow the parent reviews
",4
"people think that if people can create their own games, that instantly means it has to be inappropriate and gory.
",5
"then there's people saying that their kids got sent pictures and that people said swear words to them.
",0
"but roblox censors almost all words and even numbers.
",1
"You also can't send pictures, so I have no idea why they're doing this.

"The only problems I have about the game are that things can cost more than a hundred dollars, so don't let your kid see your credit card while they're playing roblox.
",7
"Do not play this, roblox has really violent games for example Phantom Forces has guns (Plus,roblox also has nukes,knives killing bombs and other dangerous weapons, also robux (I feel like roblox just scams people into handing over their money (and whenever you buy something it is a waste of money) there is also swearing,hate language and bullying.

"I absolutely do not recomend this to anybody
",5
"Also if you are not comfortable with your child making online friends then don’t get Roblox.
",7
"As for things like swear words Roblox makes anything like that ##### you can’t even type numbers.

"Also don’t go to any websites claiming to give free robux that could compromise your account.

"I'm tired of seeing all the Karens and kids trying to make it sound bad because of certain aspects that are being monitored.
",2
"Even though roblox tags out bad words or sexual phrases people still curse for example by doing this you b** .

"I have had to report a lot of people for being very inappropriate to people pretended to have sex.
",1
"Even though they tag out the full bad word or sexual phrase people still find a way to be inappropriate.
",1
"This app could even teach your kids bad words they did not know about.
",7
"Things to look out for:Scam sites promoting free robux are false and will take the information you give and steal your account.Another thing to look out for is bullies and child predators,luckily,they are very rare and are usually taken down by the moderators.
",5
"They are a bussiness.
",2
"Roblox has a censoring system too strict, so swearing or really anything harmful can't actually get through unless they bypass the filter, which the patch constantly.
",1
"Nowdays, violence on Roblox really doesn't go pass.
",3
"Sure, there is dying, but kids mature enough to play this can handle some death.
",3
"The moderation system is, well, slacked, but it usually doesnt pass the first-time moderation.
",1
"But please understand, you are being a bit harsh on a game that is trying its best:
",8
"
",0
"There are many posts about the admins and game in itself having bad moderation and disregard for rule breaking.
",4
"I too have encountered ODers (Online Daters), creepy players, or even hackers But it is best to just report and avoid the game where these acts were witnessed.
",8
"Roblox does regulate received reports; I was once playing a game called Dungeon Quest where a player scammed me off a legendary item which I had worked hours to obtain.
",0
"I later found out that his account had been removed from the game... permanently, it turns out that he had been reported for such acts multiple other times.
",0
"The point is that Roblox cannot delete a player just based off one clumsy report.
",0
"There are certain factors that could have been variables in that player's actions, and if that player does commit such acts often then Roblox does take action.
",1
"About those supposed ""Six Games"" on Roblox, it is best to just avoid them and report them to the moderators as much as possible, I personally will never visit one as long as I live.

"I do not recommend banning the game in your household unless you have directly witnessed indecent behavior.

"This game is awful.

"The chat is awful and some of the games, here are some examples.

"The community/chatting: The community is not family friendly.

"A lot of people make fun of others by calling them mean names and there is a lot of cussing.
",2
"Yes Roblox bleeps most of it out some people find a way to do it.

"A lot of horrible things can happen through that.

"The games: Some of the games can be violent, unclean or innapropiate.

"Roblox isn't about making games it is about playing them so there isnt any learning going on in this game.

"BE CAREFUL the privacy on here is awful.

"Don't get itm

"Children are in no danger of leaking out personal information as it gets blocked by the chat filter (if they have under 13 mode enabled) I've seen some reviews talk about the ads that lure children into other sites, that is simply not true.

"Overall, if your child has common sense and isnt gullible enough to fall for scammers telling them to go to websites for ""free robux"" and knows about online safety then they will have a great experience.
",7
"Watch out for bullies being mean to your child and if they ever do bother them, they can leave the game and join another server with different people.

"However, some games can get violent.
",3
"Theres exploiters (Roblox cant do anything about it since their moderation team is small), There are online daters and i think nothing more (ROBLOX is taking action of the online daters).
",2
"Some games can be enjoyable, but the problem is ROBUX.
",2
"Many games require robux for gamepasses which can get annoying.
",6
"Robux can be a big problem for kids since they have to pay real money and they can complain if they don't get any robux, but I didn't do that, just saying what can happen.
",7
"This game can also be inappropriate sometimes like in games like Paradise Life with online daters and more.
",1
"People are mean sometimes.
",2
"Community's of games like jailbreak can get really toxic, they  can get really angry, spam in chat and swear, even though it's in tags, you can still understand what they say.
",1
"Also people can make fun of you if they kill you in jailbreak or something.
",7
"Some games can also be violent, I think parents should watch what there kids are playing.
",7
"This game can be a money grabber sometimes making kids angry, so I think it's better for them to avoid the game or let them play games that don't have much to purchase for or don't have any.

"So  roblox can be a problem if not monitored, or don't let them play it.

"Your child will most likely stop playing Roblox during adolescence.

"Players can easily send words that might not be suitable for anyone under 18 years of age.

"There are lots of messages that say “stupid” “noob”  “boomer” and “dumb”.

"In some games, it might have a feature to allow you to play audio from the ROBLOX audio library and some players might play weird audio that might contain words used for roasts and insults so I don’t recommend going in those games.

"Next is violence.

"However, some people go for another purpose that’s not good for kids and teens.

"They do something called “Online Dating” and they use the game’s features to do some weird stuff.

"The majority of the reviews here a completely false.
",2
"I quite honestly have no idea where these angry parents get their crazy, misleading stories from.
",2
"For the parents that are saying that there are ""lots of inappropriate games and they're never getting banned"".
",2
"Games like this get banned in hours and it is breaking the TOS of roblox.

"There is only one problem with this game though, it is very very very very very addictive.

"Once you are playing you can't put your device down, the company makes loads of money while the kids suffer with problems from this  game.
",9
"It makes your family argue because you had so much time on there and enough is enough.

"Therefore, Roblox has not had a positive impact on our family, easier to say it taught me how to lie, be mean to my friends in real life and to steal.

"Speaking of, I've met a lot of users who have targeted/stalked/harassed/bullied me for silly reasons, such as telling them to stop bullying someone for being a noob.
",1
"You should disable chat for your child if you don't want them bullied.
",7
"The Robux itself is pretty pricey, and it is very easy to get scammed in game without privacy settings on, my two younger siblings were a victim of this.

"If someone is breaking the rules on ROBLOX, they probably will get off with a warning and many people can falsely report you if they are angry at you.

"It is also impossible to make a great game if you don't know how to script, which goes against the tagline saying powering imagination.

"Roblox is pretty addicting but has flaws that can't be avoided, sadly.

"From my experience, Roblox includes some friendly games and kind players around the ages of 8, but the older players are the real problem of Roblox.

"They have the virtual money, called robux, which causes in many arguments and tears between kids and parents.

"They bully the young players, calling them 'dumb' and 'noobs' and teasing them.

"Sure, the moderation and occasional toxic behaviour is kind of a problem, but other than that, ROBLOX is a completely harmless game.

"Parents, if your child has experienced bad or scarring behaviour on the platform, don’t blame it on ROBLOX.

"Parents, you people are overreacting more than you think.

"You may come across some bad games, but reporting sometimes works on games.

"Just like the websites, if something tells you that you can get free robux, don't trust it.

"You will NOT get your ""free robux"".

"I have experienced hacks before, and I myself have tested out some scams that didn't work.
",3
"None of them worked.
",7
"Roblox is a good game with a horrible community.
",3
"A lot of people play this game, most are not kid friendly, I myself and 10 year veteran and have seen the horrible era where Roblox really had to crack down on the filtering system, thus a lot of words(and all numbers) becoming hashtags.

"Now, it's filled with cyber bullies, some very rambunctious(Not in the friendly way) children, and some extremely toxic people.

"I. myself have only encounter a pedohile once, in 2012 I believe, it was very obvious what he was trying to do and I quickly shut him down, but other than that I've been fine.

"This game also has some very adult games such as Breaking Point, Phantom Forces, Witching Hour, Seconds Til Death, Alone in a Dark House, Murder Mystery(Yes, it's it a bad game to put in front of children, look at the name.

"These parents saying ""My ChIlD wAs ExPoSeD tO bAd ImAgEs!

"In no way does roblox allow that behavior.

"2 the filter, the filter is ok but it gets worse and worse in by the days go along they #ed number regular word spelled wrong and some times you cant say anything at all like this one time where you could not say anything it was a glitch that made the filter broken so you could not talk at all.
",5
"also there are tons of micro transactions that your kid will use robux to buy the thing and some times there a scam.
",6
"First of all, you cant just say that reporting ""doesn't work"" roblox's moderation is composed of bots and what not so if you are saying your child has reported some dude who was bullying them and they aren't banned yet, I mean c'mon man, if roblox had real life moderators they would get so overwhelmed with all the trolls and the legitimate reports.
",9
"Moderators have a personal life too they can't just spend their day sorting dumb reports on a kids game.
",6
"Second, if you think your child has been abused or has seen bad things, it ain't roblox's fault, you can just go and basically ruin roblox's reputation on this lame site cus some jerk made a bad game, or some 40 year old man called your kid ""cute"" roblox can't stop these things knowing that the games your child is playing are user generated content, meaning that Roblox doesn't make the games, but other community members do.
",7
"Third, there IS no violence to this game, there are weapons but really it is rather comical when your character ""dies"" it makes a funny OOF sound and your character falls apart into tiny pieces but hes still smiling.
",2
"Fourth, parents aren't giving their children enough privacy, with these things being concealed from parents, like making a roblox account under their noses for example, will automatically make parents believe something shady is going on and they will immediately want to check on their kids the first sight of suspicion.

"This makes things annoying.

"Parents get mad at roleplay games like adopt and raise a baby because they find little baby's ""inappropriate"".

"which is not roblox's fault.

"I see a lot of reviews about parents saying that this game is inappropriate and has sexual content and I'm writing this to explain things better.

"Now I understand that parents might not want their kids talking to strangers but know it is not roblox's fault if some edgy teen starts say inappropriate stuff.
",7
"If you don't want your child to see chats or be able to chat just  simply go to your settings turn off those options.
",7
"Even if someone tries to swear on the site roblox's filter will censor it and you will get a message like this ""#####"".
",1
"There are some flaws in roblox's censor system though.
",1
"Sometimes when you spell something wrong Roblox's censor system will think you are swearing and will hastags your messages.
",1
"I've heard stories of children getting into games where other players do sexual things to that child's avatar and I just want to say that that stuff is very rare.
",8
"If your child is in a server with people who are doing stuff that is not child friendly you are unlucky.
",7
"I understand that if your child sees that stuff at a very young age it can be scaring.
",7
"If you find things that are inappropriate you should report the game.
",7
"Now when I say if you find things that are inappropriate in the game I don't mean things players are doing or saying.
",1
"I'm talking about if the game by itself with the players is bad.
",3
"Your child will most likely never find any inappropriate games on Roblox ever so you have nothing to worry about but for whatever reason some parents think that murder mystery and jailbreak are bad games that will make your child violent (they don't ive played these games hundreds of times and my friend would say I wouldn't even hurt a fly) and they don't want there children playing them.
",3
"There is honestly nothing you can to do to stop them from playing those games except for telling them not to and monitor what they are playing.
",7
"Roblox is a game for everyone and people need to stop hating on it and say it's just for adults or just for kids and saying that the whole platform is filled with inappropriate content.
",4
"Like, I've seen way more Consumerism, Swearing and Violence.

"So your child can't interact and people can't interact with the child.
",5
"i've played roblox since i was 7, and all you parents saying your child got exposed to images of sex, there are maybe one or two games that are based on sex, but those get banned in like 30 mintues.

"also, you cant send images on roblox.

"links cant go past the filter, either.

"and please, please do not constantly watch your kid, i know i dont have kids, but my parents do.
",7
"i have helicopter parents and lemme tell ya, it makes them sneaky.
",4
"These parents dont know that people can report the guys to roblox, If you're being bullied JUST REPORT DUMMIE.
",7
"Some games are perfectly kid friendly, some have guns and violence, some are literally based off of gangsters fighting in the streets.
",7
"Some role-playing games have Online Daters (or ODers) who do inappropriate things and swear.
",1
"Do not play roblox it have oders and a lot of swearing please do not play this game and purchases like Robux and Roblox Premuim
",7
"NOTE: Many people judge players by their looks, so a lot of new players might be bullied for 'having no Robux'.
",5
"Roblox, like any platform geared for children, has some players who attempt to break the Terms of Service of Roblox and do things that are... probably illegal.
",6
"There are also Scam Bots, who directly target players with Scams, trying to either waste the time of the victim or steal the victim's Roblox account, from either logging cookies to even snatching the .ROBLOSECURITY code of the victim (which can be used to immediately log into your account, BYPASSING 2FA).

"- If you think that Roblox is causing the corruption of your kids and should be made only for Adults, you should actually just be a parent and monitor what your kids are doing.

"Roblox is a platform not a game.
",2
"people in the community  create the games on roblox sure in some games there is violence but that's why 13 up accounts exist.Sometimes  inappropriate things do pop up but Roblox goes and cracks down almost immediately.Another reason you might be concerned is online dating or ODing ,most of the time its just kids harmlessly role playing in the case it does go far (in which it almost never happens) it is because they are loured into other platforms not Roblox.

"Ok, so I hear on these posts about parents and teens complaining about bullies and stuff.
",4
"But, you should also know that its a online world with a freedom of speech, and with that freedom, there might just be some rude teen or kid calling your kid ""Noob"", ""Trash"", ""Useless"", ""Idiot"", ""Stupid"", or any of those stuff.

"There isnt any problem with this site, its just the fact that Roblox is still working to patch up exploits and stuff.

"If you find that it is some ""stalker"" or ""hacker"" repeaditely asking for personal info, parents, make sure the child tells whats happening because hacking and stalking must be taken seriously.

"Additionally, it will only let you kid play Curated Content on Roblox.

"This make your kid only be able to play games that are set to below 12 years old by Roblox.

"The way the player dies by by shouting a diminutive ""oof"" and then just falling apart.

"It's not really disgusting or bloody or horrible at all.

"TIPS:
",0
"
",0
" 1: If somebody is being rude to your child, just block them.
",7
"2: ""Noob"" is just a weak insult.
",2
"3: ROBLOX is NOT a game.
",2
"4: ROBLOX's moderation team is low, just block users and just not let your kid play that game in the ROBLOX PLATFORM!!!!
",7
"Also, if they try to use numbers to swear, it will also be tagged.
",1
"Im was playing welcome to bloxburg and then someone started hacking the game and putting bad pickchures on the screen :( my mommy made me uninstall and too much swears too
",0
"In this game, there are some violent games.
",3
"But you can block that from your kids by emailing roblox staff, there is a bunch of people saying that Roblox is bad.
",7
"Just click cancel.
",5
"This can result in their account getting hacked or your credit card getting charged for Robux (virtual currency) purchases.
",7
"I watch out for scams and online dating, But warning: This game called Meep City has online daters, and it is flooded.
",8
"I recommend to not play it.
",7
"i mean is ur kid that stupid they give out information?
",7
"===================================================
",0
"If they're in a game and they're getting insulted, tell them to block the person who is insulting your child.
",7
"===================================================
",0
"Sorry if this isn't much, this is mostly what I know, also parents, know that a lot of players curse on Roblox, so beware.
",1
"I do not get why parents freak out about this game but for the first part of this, l will put three different reviews OTHER people have given on Roblox.
",6
"Inappropriate Content
",0
"
",0
" ""I have been on the fence about this website until today.
",2
"A hacker replaced kitten wallpaper in a game with anime porn.
",9
"Because of this, I would say it is not safe for children.""
",4
"""Shocked at the sex talk""
",0
"
",0
"An 11-year old I know was propositioned on here, she said no and her online Roblox character was picked up and thrown into the bed...can I call this online rape?
",0
"When I found this out, the account was canceled.
",0
"The character who ""raped"" her character also used another language with her in the chatbox that made it seem like he was a lot older than she was.
",0
"Creepy.
",0
"""BAD!!!!!!!!!!!""
",0
"A lot of players curse and sometimes they act sex act and there are wars and hacks that can really mess up your computer don't let your kid play and also the mods don't do anything about the reports they only do it for the money.
",7
"Just do that, and don't play that game!
",7
"If your Roblox account gets banned/cancelled, you can appeal your account in customer service.
",5
"That should filter all mature content and turn off the messaging part, so these people can't say things to your daughter.
",1
"The report abuse button in games report the problem to the developers for the game, but not Roblox.
",9
"ROBLOX's chat filter bans  Numbers as well as swear words and things that can relate to swear words.
",1
"Roblox games can also be violent.
",8
"this game shouldn’t be a problem for you or your child unless they are not properly educated on online etiquette.
",7
"if you are a responsible parent, there is no reason why your child should run into any dangerous or extremely inappropriate situations.
",7
"ROBLOX is a very disgusting game, it has a lot of swearing and kids think its okay to drink wine or beer because theres no side effect to the character.
",5
"There is a lot of violence, killing, shooting, and even just melee killing someone.
",2
"This concludes why ROBLOX is a disgusting game and EVERY kid should play it
",1
"For the inappropriate games, just don't let them play them in the first place.
",7
"For violence there's no blood or gore so why so bad.
",3
"The game is good but Some games i play has bullying words violence The game i say is called The streets is a game ilke GTA 5 For 1 up to 10 players are bullying killing and more and a game called tower of h### and The tower of h### has super rage and race it can be age of 5 up to 13 and pepole are making Scam game and coning to our games With friends and says free robux?
",9
"And say to join us and friend us and The game says robux and says come to The robux and it says password and type it The owner gets it and hack us and a report i send doesn’t work and scammers are every where if there is kids out there kids can give our there information to scammers...
",5
"Some games can be violent and not suitable for younger ages.
",3
"Don't give out your password;
",7
"There is a high chance that someone will confiscate your account, however, there is a possibility that they weren't lying however this is highly unlikely.
",8
"Blocking/muting- If someone is saying bad things to you, you can block them by going to the player list (in the top right), clicking the username of the rude person, and then clicking the rectangle that says ""Block"".
",5
"This will make all the chat that the blocked person says be invisible forever, but can be undone.
",1
"If this happens, don't blame Roblox, just blame yourself, as you'd be the stupid one for  having a password that even a child can infer.
",5
"Even numbers are censored.
",1
"This can be EXTREMLEY annoying at times, however, this prevents people from saying their age.
",4
"However, Roblox takes 30% of it (if you're angry it's because Roblox would get bankrupt if they didn't).
",5
"You just need to be cautious when playing the game for anything questionable.
",4
"I think there are too many overreactions on this game, but, I think that the in-game currency ""ROBUX"" is highly overpriced- you used to be able to pay $200 for R$35,000, but now $100 for R$ 11,000 WITH a monthly premium subscription.
",6
"There is some cussing and bullying in this game, but, that would happen in any game.
",1
"The scripts allow users to do inappropriate things in the game, but that is mainly only with paid exploits.
",1
"If you have a user that is harassing you, just block them.
",3
"And most of the chatting apps don't have swear filter.
",2
"You can't say words like, 's--t, and if you type that in game, it appears like this, '####'.
",1
"And having no Hashtags appear.
",9
"KEEP IN MIND; The moderation system is not great at all.
",2
"Reporting a player usually does NOTHING.
",1
"It's not that bad as you make it out to be.
",7
"It's not Roblox's fault that your kid stole your credit card and bought a couple thousand robux.
",7
"ROBLOX will randomly and unjustly ban and delete acounts, and the appeals process will end in one, swift E-mail, and it will likely end in your account not being recovered, as the appeals system is mainly ran by bots.
",6
"On top of that, ROBLOX is in truth a hive of violence, swearing, and other illicit topics.
",9
"Want a couple games that your kid should NOT play?
",7
"The Streets, basically gangs in a Lego game.
",0
"Now you might be saying ""Hey, parents are saying I should steer clear of this game, I don't really feel comfortable.""
",7
"If you don't trust your parenting abilities enough, good for you.
",5
"There is a line of code on Roblox called ""filtering enabled"" which with a lot of exploit programs wont work properly (If you want more details on this, just google it or something I don't know).
",2
"But one downside to this is if the exploits are for cheating, this can really ruin a game.
",2
"There is way more to Roblox but I just don't feel like writing it.
",2
"Great Game but not liking the ROBLOX black friday.
",2
"A few years ago I joined roblox and have been encountering bad things like sex.
",6
"And by encountering those, i'd recommend DON'T PLAY ROBLOX.
",7
"If there is oding, it's just roleplay or dumb kids stuff.
",8
"Roblox takes the blame of too many parents, for things that are out of the company's control.
",2
"Roblox is not your babysitter.
",7
"There are some safety and Privacy concerns, such as phishing and scam sites.
",5
"They even have a guide of how to prevent kids from falling for this trick.
",4
"Usually, they would be talking nonsense in order to swear.
",2
"The inappropriate content games are usually deleted in about a day to a week.
",1
"Lots of parents are complaining about this, but they only say bad stuff about ROBLOX.
",2
"Violence is the last problem.
",9
"The guns aren't even doing proper gun noises and it just shoots some yellow bar.
",8
"It does model them properly and however, parents are probably going to think the popular jail roleplay games that have guns in them INDUCE violence, and even make their kids promote gangs.
",8
"The violence inducing part is only for ""special"" kids usually.
",4
"The community, which is the last to talk about here is not the most friendly.
",2
"Sometimes there are bullies, I play this game myself, and there are some EXTREMELY toxic players.
",2
"The parents that extremely downvote this game are dumb, and don't actually take a look into this game.
",7
"Remember, be cool, stay in school adults because obviously you've never examined and analyzed something thouroghly.
",0
"sometimes there are too much swearing especially the game ,,Frappe"".
",1
"This game has so many trollers, they also sweared people in Frappe.
",1
"As a Roblox veteran (5 years, I’m a loser) These people are overreacting way too much.
",6
"Bad words tag out, violence is only for 13+ people, and there is ZERO inappropriate games that you will find on roblox unless you are purposely looking for them, and those games are shut down by roblox’s moderation within hours.
",1
"Games in which contain inappropriate topics, or are spammed to the front page are quickly taken down.
",4
"There are barely ANY games which include this kind of content, however.
",3
"I've also seen many complains that their children were sent links to bad things, photos popped up, etc.
",8
"This is clearly not true.
",2
"There is no way a picture could pop up whilst your child is playing a Roblox game, and a Link could only be sent via player by player.
",6
"If the link had anything bad in it, Roblox usually doesn't allow it to be sent.
",5
"Either hash tagging out the characters or just not sending it.
",5
"Honestly, I think many of these reviews are written by parents who don't like the look of the game, or the game in general.
",2
"Listen, if you don't like the game because of opinion, then do not go and rate a child-friendly game 18+.
",7
"Roblox has nothing 18+ inside of it, and your opinion shouldn't be written in a clickbait review for a game.
",1
"If you're worried about your young child doing inappropriate things on the website, just monitor them.
",7
"You must understand that every game will have positives and negatives, and you DO NOT understand the monetization system in under a day.
",5
"This game is overall JUST GROSS!
",2
"This game has many negative things.
",2
"Also, the players are just immature and do sexual actions in some games such as “Life in Paradise” or “Family Life”.
",1
"I would never recommend this game also because people bypass the chat filter and say bad things.
",1
"Some games such as “The Streets” has some drug use stuff.
",1
"This game overall just concerns me and is unsafe for children like me.
",3
"Lastly, there are many pedophiles in this game, they may ask for your location and then they might come to your house and could probably rape you or kill you.
",8
"They lie about there age, one person I met said she’s 12 and she wants to meet up but I believe it could be an old man.
",0
"ROBLOX may sometimes have toxic players every now and then, but you can report them first, then block them or leave the server.
",7
"Back then when I was still quite immature, people could easily bypass the chat filters so many people cursed.
",1
"This is awful.
",2
"it is not for kids, plenty of games are traumatizing and are about fighting to the death or dating or some dark themes.
",2
"most of the games are generic and make your kid yell at you forcing you to give them money so that they can get themselves robux.
",6
"plenty of people are toxic though some people are genuinely nice and some games are good but most are cash grabs most likely made by bots.
",1
"there are also scam bots in the chat and expect your child to be complaining that him/her lost their account.
",5
"very weird and dark and is rather generic.
",9
"also roblox's filter is trash and you can't say anything and its all just a way to gain money and the creator of the game also stole the oof sound from the 2000 game messiah.
",1
"that just shows how lazy this game is.
",6
"also I doubt you would feel safe on this game as its privacy is awful.
",4
"Roblox now is really toxic because of the community and content in the games.
",2
"Players now would bully you for your avatar and your performance on a game.
",4
"Many of the common insults are ""Ugly"", ""Loser"", and ""Noob.""
",8
"Scammers and bots are a major issue too.
",8
"Scammers always post a link where it would give you ""free Robux"", but those websites steal your account and give your device a virus.
",5
"If you think reporting would fix this problem.... you are WRONG!
",2
"The reports don't even get read because none of these players are getting removed or suspended.
",2
"The monitors are probably always busy or they don't even care at all.
",4
"Role-playing games are the worst because it has numerous online daters and predators.
",2
"I suggest you keep restricted mode on for child so this does not happen to them cursing, inapropriate content.
",7
"Roblox should make their money less expensive i know they want to make money but they are already making millions off of parents and little kids money.
",7
"Roblox considered people *noobs* if you don't have this so called thing Robux.
",7
"It is a joke or could also be a form of bullying.
",1
"I suggest you have a talk with your kids about this and make sure this does not happen to them if so turn off the chat feature and talk to them what their expectations of this game should be.
",7
"My friend has been scammed by this game before I suggest you be careful.
",7
"The only problem is the community inside it.
",2
"Roblox claims to filter bad words or sexual references in the chat, but some people in the community manage to slip that in.
",1
"I have encountered people swearing and fighting with each other, sometimes even online dating or using sexual references in their speech.
",1
"This way your child cannot receive or send chat messages from others.
",5
"Another thing I think is wrong with this community is something about robux.
",2
"Robux costs money, and not all 'robloxians' have it.
",6
"This leads to bullying.
",4
"The name for these people are considered, 'noobs'.
",1
"They should also know to tell you about any encounter with someone who is threatening them.
",7
"I suggest you have a talk with them about the dangers of the internet and how to handle it.
",7
"If your child is easily swayed by online influences then this is not the app they should be using.
",9
"Warning though some of these are very violent.
",2
"But the real problem is inappropriate content.
",1
"Many of the more inappropriate games have unassuming names.
",3
"The way i stay away from these games is by looking at the number of people currently playing it.
",3
"There are a lot of scammers out there trying to scam kids into buying fake robux (the in game currency that costs real money).
",8
"There is also a ridiculous amount of swearing and inappropriate conversations.
",1
"Some games have links that take you to weird bad games.
",8
"I've been playing this game for 4 years and some people say that there's to much and cursing and to much 18+ crap there's not that's really rare.
",2
"Anyways remember this is still a kids  game not a game to criticize over everything you see.
",5
"some of the games inlclude prison games, Shooter games,simulators,tycoons,and obbys.buiding games roleplay games meme games Horror games survival games ect and THERE IS BARELY ANY PEDOFILES IN THEE GAME AND THERE IS NO [Oof] GAMES AND LISTEN CAREFULLY PEOPLE ARE NOT SWEARING ALL THE TIME THE ROBLOX FILTER IS CENSORING NORMAL WORDS LIKE ""camera"" ""youtube"" and ""video"" and numbers sorry for grammer
",9
"I can say, the moderation is VERY poor, but most of the moderators are bots anyways?
",2
"So, it's not really roblox's fault.
",3
"But, it always can leak anyone's privacy.
",2
"The filter is not great and can censor words that r harmless.
",1
"This is shown by the censor system which blocks all curse words and words that could give out private details.
",1
"However, the one flaw with Roblox is the report system, known for not being completely reliable.
",9
"These people have no idea how roblox works.
",2
"but they are rule breakers and will get banned by roblox.
",1
"Just report them and move along with your day.
",7
"If you think your child is being exposed to or being manipulated just monitor your frickin kids.
",7
"If you think roblox still isn't good for you child cause of the ""oh this kid was exposed to parts of the body that are un forgettable...
",7
"they are rule breakers and will get banned.
",1
"MONITOR YOUR FRICKIN KIDS IF YOUR WORRIED ABOUT THEM BEING EXPOSED TO SOMETHING BAD OR MANIPULATED!
",0
"Most bad reviews think that ""Oh she was raped in videogame""-Not even a feature in the game, games made on roblox that have that are taken down in the hour.
",2
"THE CHILDREN CAN'T SEE GUNS!""
",0
"Some even said their child sent nudes over it!
",2
"Laughable, considering all links are immediately deleted by roblox.
",9
"If your child is that young to fall for that and you faked their age, congrats.
",4
"Now they can see all the bad.
",7
"The community can be bad, but your child can quit a game with bad people, and if you complain that a strange man came to your door asking for your daughter, (I've seen this before not even kidding), you're lying.
",7
"If you saw anything inappropriate in Roblox, then it's not the Owners fault, The workers of Roblox will ban every inapproriate Player/Game as fast as they can.
",3
"If you really think they have poor Moderation, then you are wrong.
",7
"It's true that you can get a false ban, but you can fix it with your Email Adress and message them to get your account unbanned, but you have to do this within a month, because your account is banned forever in one month.
",5
"I think Roblox should be in the age 12, because they are games with Guns, some Players that are pretty Toxic (Toxic = Bully).
",2
"Roblox is not about Sexual Content, Violence, Drugs, Safety or swearing.
",7
"There are chat filters and moderation that prevent that, if someone says a bad word, then it will be censored with #.
",1
"honestly, people try so hard to make roblox look bad-and sure, there are some cons-but i think that they shouldn't be too quick to judge this platform.
",2
"i haven't seen anything seriously bad in my entire time on roblox.
",0
"sure, people hate on people who find it fun to online date and bully people for no reason.
",4
"often times, it's just innocent roleplaying that doesn't really hurt anybody.
",4
"honestly, i would much rather focus on the talent of some game developers than get caught up in the few people who just want to ruin other people's experience.
",9
"if parents really don't like the occasional cussing or online dating or the potential that children may give out personal info, just monitor your kids on the game however you see fit.
",7
"but the complaints about how it's all ""roblox's fault"" that this is happening gets kinda old over time.
",2
"to sum this excessive and unnecessarily long review (i'm sorry about this, by the way), roblox is a great game that does have flaws, but so does every other thing in this world.
",3
"the inappropriate content is very minimal compared to the amazing amount of talent that so many devs possess.
",9
"A lot of the other reviews are saying 18+ bad game  i wouldn't recommend this to my child but that's just wrong they're talking about when you die you explode into pieces it makes sense for A game that literally looks like legos
",2
"Okay so here’s the thing you parents, on the Apple store it clearly says 13+ , yes roblox should have a thing where it separates 14+ from children but if it’s that bad **THEN DONT LET YOUR KID PLAY IT** simple as that.
",0
"Before you even let your kid play roblox just look at the reviews before you even think about giving roblox a stupid 2 stars.
",7
"Cuz that’s hella dumb that you guys are like “oh roblox this oh roblox that” like dude it’s your fault for even letting your kid play it, so think twice before even saying anything about it.
",7
"Later on things went a bit downhill, I can say.
",0
"Players can report as many times as they would like for whatever reason, but is almost never noticed.
",1
"I have reported other players for inappropriate behavior but nothing happened to him.
",1
"There is also many rude players and cyberbullies.
",1
"I have personally left the game almost crying before.
",0
"Now about the general game itself, not the players; The game is extremely boring now with little to no good games.
",4
"Most games are simulators where you simulate doing dumb things, or it's extremely repetitive and boring.
",6
"Many people have expressed this, and that's the reason why I left the game, it was no longer fun.
",0
"and this is has the same problem as simulators.
",9
"Many players find loopholes for bad language, such as; f u k, sit, s x, and beach.
",1
"There are guns and swords in this game, but it's never really gory, unless you get onto the horror, mysterious side of this game, where it's incredibly unsettling.
",3
"I've been in this part of the game and it was horrible.
",0
"What do I guys mean that there’s loads of bully’s in every game game I’ve only ever seen 2 that are actually bullying and loads people say my child was called a noob we’ll get used to what people say these days it’s really fun sometimes games get shut down for no reasons
",9
"I've got to admit, I was hella addicted, until the real world smacked me hard enough to make me realize if I didn't quit I'd be as idiotic as every other kid who still plays roblox at this age the way I did.
",5
"Other than that, your child will become idiotic, toxic (like me), and will likely do bad in school (if not now, then later on).
",7
"All of that is gone.
",2
"Roblox is full of games that expose children to online dating, and I've met people who have literally became so mentally attached they'd become depressed whenever a roblox friend left them.
",1
"Sorry for my life story, but just know this; roblox is full of creeps, isn't moderated well enough, and doesn't have a fraction of the fun/educational properties it did as before.
",3
"I’ve started seeing reviews in commonsensemedia.org and saw some unbelievable reviews kids and parents would leave.
",7
"There are multiple, varying from the reasons as to why parents complain when they see something inappropriate in-game, and just assume “oh ok, so I saw some bad words, it is a bad game.
",8
"The problem is that parents don’t frequently monitor what their children are doing in their devices, so they assume it’s ok. Parents that actually understand what ROBLOX is, actually have views where it’s good and bad.
",7
"Just assuming that it’s a bad game without sufficient evidence will immediately throb your opinion, and would just consider “irrelevant”.
",1
"Kids with boredom will always need a way to pass time, otherwise, they will have social anxiety.
",3
"If not, doesn’t complete purchase, and if unauthorized, to be deleted from ROBLOX.
",7
"Most people keep saying that ""Roblox is for trash"" but they probably still play Fortnite.
",4
"The only problem is some part of the community are oders, trollers or whatever but you can report them or just leave the server.
",1
"And I'm not the person who stalks the person waiting for him/her to be banned, I don't care.
",0
"Downsides are mostly bypassing the rules, and online dating  while I have seen some online daters while inappropriate stuff is around “wanna be my boyfriend/girlfriend “ and wanna date, things like that.
",1
"I thing the games can only get by the worst by shooting games, which aren’t very bad and recreating games like grand theft auto.
",8
"There are some dating kinda things but you should just ignore them, there is lots of bullying but you should just ignore it.
",2
"Honestly you killed the game in early 2017.
",6
"The filter made me want to cry when I couldn't say what I wanted to say.
",5
"2017 SUCKED!
",1
"Forums merged and were deleted that year, the stupid filter system that blocked every word in the Oxford Dictionary, when crappy YouTubers like greenlegocats123 and legobloxian brainwashed their 8 year old fanbase to believe every person with Beautiful Hair for Beautiful People was a pedophile, removal of guest...oh yeah let's talk about the impact those youtubers like CowCow made.
",5
"Rip Flamingo, had to change his upload style to suit Roblox's childish fanbase.
",0
"The eight year olds that watched legobloxian and CowCow are now the children you see that wear Bighead and get insecure when you tell them that filter-bypassing the n-word isn't funny,
",5
"Yeah, there might be people online dating or cursing, but it gets fixed just write what the user is doing and they get a punishment.
",1
"Some parents are saying how bad Roblox is I disagree because if you go to settings you can change the settings for your child’s safety.
",5
"Only play the games that are for kids there are teens trying to be edgy and all that but this is a reminder stay away from them they can be mean.
",8
"There is no sexual content and if there was roblox would ban it immediately.
",2
"Roblox is a platform where other players create games for people to play, but any games with innapropiate content will be banned like I said before.
",2
"Keep in mind roblox does have in game purchases and children can get cyberbullied if they have not paid for they're avatar, if this happens it's ok, this is a very rare issue anyways, just talk to your child about it and befor you know it they will be playing again and ignoring any mean comments.
",7
"The pedophiles have died down A LOT, but there is still online dating.
",2
"it also replaces curse words and other inappropriate stuff by turning it into: ####.
",1
"it's moderation isn't that great, so reporting stuff with the built-in report system isn't really useful but, you can also you can try to tweet Roblox.
",8
"There are a few games that involve a bit of horror or violence, but it's very lowkey and the graphics aren't detailed.
",3
"The chat is a very censored place.
",1
"Even simple words like ""love"" are censored out, which, I admit can be annoying.
",1
"Sharing private information and asking for it is totally taboo.
",5
"Those kids that know more then they should are making it seem bad!
",7
"Parents are making a big deal out of it, If you care so much TALK TO YOUR CHILD!!!!
",8
"If your child is doing that stuff then they have some serious problems.
",7
"Roblox tries to keep kids and teenagers from doing that stuff but they just keep finding more hacks.
",7
"There are some games that have violence, but it is not as gruesome as shooting someone in GTA.
",3
"Occasionally people might swear, if they do you can just leave the game.
",7
"People may occasionally bully others for having no robux which is a currency in roblox, but you can report them which is still being fixed but only works in a 1 ot of 20 chance that they will get warned or banned depending on the situation.
",6
"The cons of this are, Roblox having many ways for games to allow cash grabbing ( Even roblox it self does it ),  This game also allows for false advertising.
",4
"There is also inappropriate ads.
",1
"There is also language, blood, cyberbullying, and scariness in some games on roblox.
",7
"The only downside is that the admins of roblox do censor bad things but somtimes when I am building a game I will come across a inipropreate model.
",2
"Also theres a lot of hackers but if your smart they wont hack you.
",8
"Roblox is fine but parents have been blowing the online daters and the questionable things out of proportion.
",8
"Parents are very quick to judge when it comes to things and roblox is definitely no different as parents and the mainstream media relentlessly attack roblox for supposedly being dangerous for kids and certain player's for doing things like standing close to another player and for being online daters (which online dating is against the roblox rules) and online dating isn't much of an issue as people just need to report them and to not cry about it.
",8
"The robux and premium/BC costing real money and people has been bullying kids for not having robux at all.
",6
"Most online daters are just kids who just want a virtual girlfriend/boyfriend and a very very VERY small percentage of online daters are actual predictors.
",2
"scam bots show up VERY OFTEN and if you get a message saying ""come to this website to claim free robux"" DON'T DO THAT.
",5
"I have stumbled across bad things here and there.

"I don’t understand how parents find this game bad.
",2
"It’s not the game’s fault, If you are 7-9 years old, maybe have someone supervise you.
",7
"Some people on roblox break rules but most of the time, they are just little kids who haven’t read rules or just being bad with hopes they don’t get caught.
",2
"If you do see someone rule-breaking, report it instead of ranting about it to the company.
",9
"Or would you leave a bad review to the company?
",7
"Rule-breakers isn’t Roblox’s fault, Thank you.

"Many parents think Roblox is a bad influence on some kids just because of one instance involving a character getting raped in game.
",2
"Though, there are some rude people on the game.
",1
"Sometimes you come across scams.
",7
"The most popular scams are the “free robux” scams.
",8
"It’s best to stay away from those.
",4
"Ok now on roblox there are a lot of games that involve killing other players but it's nothing graphic Cuz it's a kid and teen game.
",3
"Most people don't build stuff on roblox because it's hard and requires scripting.
",8
"Watch out for bullying tho there are mean people there.
",1
"Also cursing is usually tagged but sometimes it bypasses the filter like Ex.
",1
"Its weird sometimes.
",0
"Number 1, ROBLOX is made for kids, meaning if anyone places ANYTHING that is not child appropiate, ROBLOX administators are going to track them down, and ban then.
",6
"Number 3... Any parents saying this game is bad is blind and can't see what kids can see.
",4
"A lot of the time it's just up to you wether you're in a toxic environment or not.
",1
"A lot of the toxic things kids do on there isn't necessarily roblox's fault rather it's the parents.
",5
"If some 11 year old is trying to have cybersex with an 8 year old on a roblox game then that's not roblox fault.
",4
"I tell you, I've spend probably over $100 of my own money for roblox because the other players pressure and bully those who don't have robux.
",6
"When you are 10 years old trying to play a game and have fun but you get called ""noob"" every time you get sick of it.

"EDIT : Also I rarely ever see online dating in the game.
",2
"Adults don't know the difference between roleplay and online dating.
",8
"Trust me, after they leave the server they probably aren't ever gonna see their virtual family again.
",7
"Although, many naughty  users always try to break the rules.
",5
"Child predator are lurking happily in some family roleplay games (like Adopt Me!
",8
"Chat filter in ROBLOX are pretty strict.
",1
"Your child cant share their real name, age, birth date, and other personal info coz ROBLOX blocked any kind of numbers and real name, especially surname.
",7
"ROBLOX dont allowed online dating too.
",4
"Games that not  for kids:
",4
"Shower simulator, Dance Club, Dank Memes (if ur child has epilepsy dont allow them to play this), Rockfeller Meme 300 (epileptic warning), any horror games, Jeff The Killer, Granny, and Broken Bones IV (promote self harming by throwing yourself at the cliff and get XP)

"However, if you want your child to became a gamemaker on ROBLOX.
",7
"The coding is kinda hard for kids, thats why ROBLOX Studio need Parental Guidance.

"Thank you for understanding ROBLOX is not dangerous and safe for kids.
",8
"Vulgar language are mostly censored and replaced with ""#"".
",1
"Inappropriate pictures on items in the catalogue and the ads on the site will be checked and verified by ROBLOX Admins before they go up.
",9
"Also regarding scams, there are many games and sites for ""Free"" ROBUX, ROBUX is the currency used in ROBLOX and have to be purchased.
",1
"Targeting kids, these free ROBUX scams will bait them to give their username and password for their ROBLOX account and they will be hacked.
",5
"And sometimes if you don't have robux, you may get bullied mainly on Roleplay games.
",7
"And make sure your kids know not to trust players who type ""Friend me for free robux"" or anything related to free robux.
",7
"And the reason for monitoring your child for Roleplay Games is because children can give out personal information to possible predators.
",7
"Or your child might do inappropriate acts.
",7
"And you want to only let your kids give out personal information to only friends they know in real life.
",7
"The games within could be the problems, and sometimes even the players.
",1
"This game is not for any body for ANY age, that is super sensitive towards other people's actions.
",1
"Its also a place where people would break old relationships.
",4
"This can be serious and must be prevented before it happens.
",4
"I thought at first it sucked just because it was laggy until I realise it was my IPADS fault.
",0
"I worry about the game giving out my private crap but I make too many assumptions.
",3
"I don’t like when players in roblox and quick too judge about the way you look based on the view they see you on (their screen).
",8
"I also dislike when people think based on how many years you’ve played a game your the best or worst, you can go to school your HOLE life and come home knowing 1% of what the teacher actually said.
",7
"There is a currency called Robux, but some people get bullied for not having Robux.
",6
"I suggest ignoring those people and mind your business.
",7
"There are these things called “scam bots” that enter games and say “Go to this shady website for “free” Robux!” If you go to that website they will ask you for your username and password, so they can hack you.
",5
"DO NOT GO TO THESE WEBSITES!
",0
"There are however people that call others noobs, people who online date even though the rules say NOT to.
",4
"It's funny that even I found guests annoying and then regretted finding them annoying when they were removed.
",8
"I've seen reviews about parents complaining about ""bad activity"".
",2
"If you are suspicious of your childs act on the internet, MODERATE THEM.
",7
"Your children will criticize the fact that you don't care if they post extra information, Inappropriate activity, or even worse.
",5
"Would you really wan too talk to a 3 year old you cannot understand?
",7
"The website does include drugs, sex, and lots of violence.
",3
"The Parents don't seem to realize that Roblox does not make the games and Roblox is just a website.
",8
"The website is not a scam its only if your child asks all the time just for robux and premium, most of the scam games on the website are botted and get banned by like the next dayI'm only saying the Moderation in the chat can break sometimes and somebody will be able to curse.
",5
"The website does not contains sex unless somebody hacked its which haven't happened in 7 years.
",6
"The only time sex will be involed is if a game slipped pass the moderation, there is a hacker, or the player can be fricking and online dating.
",5
"Before you let your child play you need to 100% make sure you teach her or him to never give out personal infermation unless something is verififed and not a scam of a way somebody can kill you.
",7
"Roblox dont banned you for no reason by the way.
",6
"You will be banned for swearing,porn,drugs scams,hacking, and bullying.
",5
"I want most of the adult to read the kids review because the parents dont pay attention to the game just see and be like ""OK THERE IS FRICKING AND SMOKING"" And with the swearing alot of words get censord for no reason and some non bad words get censord too such as frick, heck and crap.
",3
"There is no support for developers.
",6
"My helicopter kit which is the most advanced on roblox continues to suffer leak attacks and contacting roblox about it has done nothing about it.
",9
"The only developer support is for front page games and developing on it might get you spare cash but they dont care about their smaller developers
",6
"I would give this a 5 star rating except the Roblox filters is kind of useless and they need to do better on their safety standards.
",6
"Sure their may be some violence depending on the game mainly pixelated gun violence but honestly it’s almost like nerf guns by that meaning they are not detailed and just add to the game.
",3
"Will keep young ones distracted for hours and parents can rest easy knowing children won’t pick up anything up off the game due to developers of the platform knowing the demographic.
",5
"This game called roblox is not a game in fact it's a platform for games.
",4
"Don't listen to negative parents because they don't know a simple thing aout roblox, parents will just see one bad thing and instantly go to this website and write hate about roblox.
",9
"Something parents don't know is that the games are user generated which means it's not the fault of the creators of the website.
",9
"If there is a bad thing you see in roblox then that just because the bad error is either trolling/joking or the person is a kid with horrible parents who don't supervise their kids.
",7
"Speaking of supervision you should make sure you suervise you kid otherwise they will do bad things.
",7
"There are games in roblox that can be about dating but let it be on the platform and don't let your kid play it because dating in a rule and the game will shut down in a few years.
",2
"Some people can say bad words in roblox but if you report them they will either get banned or get a warning.
",1
"If your the one who gets banned then just check the reason but if there is no reason then it's jist an accident but the accident is rare so don't worry.
",6
"Parents are very toxic about roblox because if you think about it not many parents watch their children and the kids do bad stuff which can make parents think it's a bad Ganesh.
",7
"yeah yeah, it can be a little dangerous with hackers and stuff, or your kids can play bad  games in it.
",8
"(to clarify, roblox bans these games instantly when they notice).
",2
"Instead of making your kid NOT play this game anymore if he experiences something bad, moderate him and don't be lazy.
",0
"ROBLOX can have a few inappropriate games but they are usually deleted in less than a day, there can be some intense violence but there are no realistic characters usually.
",3
"ROBLOX contains lots of spam such as clothing spam such as when you search ""nike"" you will get lots of expensive shirted named ""NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE"" and so on so on, there are also scam bots that try to get you to go to fishy scam sites for ""Free Robux"".
",8
"One of the bad things is that the moderation can be awful at times such as getting terminated for a false reason, or getting banned for literally saying how are you, Roblox has said that they would be improving their moderation system.
",9
"For users under 13 I recommend setting your age when you sign up to anything over 13 as under 13 accounts have a system called ""Safe chat"" which doesn't actually make it any safer at all.
",5
"Unfortunately there is no single player mode except in Roblox Studio which is only on PC but if you play multiplayer you'll find online daters and people who make fun of you for not having roux calling you a noob even though noob means new player and you make an epic comeback but it gets censored and everyone makes fun of you for it so you report them but they don't get banned or even warned so you block them and they just make a new account and bully you on that one so you join another game but it was hack
",7
"There are people that online date, exploit, or  in the rarest cases, bully.
",1
"Also, to teens playing,  do not assume that somebody gained robux by stealing their mom’s   credit card.
",7
"But... the chat filter is just messed up.
",1
"Soo I saw a lot of ratings saying that they've been hack things like that.Roblox is a community platform so roblox isnt responsible at all if someone makes an inaproppiate game.But if they do they get banned.Also your kid/s is/are responsible what game they play and what they do or if lets say they make a game.They might get ban because there is a big chance that they used a model that has a ''virus''.I think roblox is a great game with a great community but watch out for dem stupids.You are welcome if this
",7
"It was good till then but slowly things changed at 2018 due to inappropriate stuff crisis which is still a problem for Roblox and also it became more toxic I am sure we all miss good old moments.
",6
"Stay away from games like Meepcity or ecc..
",8
"It became more boring in my opinion especially the polandball roblox trend is stupid.
",1
"The thing about these parents is they dont know ANYTHING about roblox, do you really think roblox allows swearing?
",7
"theyre kids just bypassing, i think you should actually look after your kid first.
",7
"to any parents reading this and have no idea of what the hell is going on in roblox let your kid play roblox, but keep watch.
",7
"Current describing words: bad, overrated, rotten.

"However, over the years, more and more bad characters have targeted this game and caused the community to rot.
",1
"With many things to consider  before choosing to purchase Roblox, you may have a hard time.
",4
"This will leak into your bank account and steal money, in the form of what seems like a scam.
",5
"If your child chooses to report someone for say, hacking, the moderators will probably not do anything about it, for they are only interested in business related problems.
",7
"This certain game or platform has turned into a dating site.
",2
"Lot's of people, young and old, have made this into a dating site.
",2
"Since swearing is such a huge problems, the players have figured out ways to get around the filter.
",1
"Say 'three' is a bad word, the people could do this: th r ee,  or this: thr#e .
",5
"When it comes to actual bad words, people use single letters or abbreviations.
",1
"Violence brings use to our 5th and final con of the day.

"If the filter would not censor messages like ""You have ## (30) seconds left.""

"[BC, TBC, or OBC are the old ones, which have been sadly wiped entirely out of the platform {:(}, so I don't need to explain it further to you.]
",6
"The moderation does work, while it make take a few weeks for people to get banned or temp banned it still does happen, also now that Roblox now has filtering enabled for all games (has been since 2018 I believe), which sadly breaks many old games, it limits what hackers are able to do

"
",0
"(sorry for bad grammar lol)
",6
"Some parents reviews complain about appropriateness in Roblox and the creepy old man stalker scenario but quite frankly, Roblox is a very censored game.

"People say that ODers can be 18-50 years old to do sexual things to children.

"The parents are overreacting.

"Roblox is a great game for kids, however I wouldn't recommend this game for kids under 10, I myself have played for three years, if this was a few years ago I would recommend it to younger kids, however over time the community has become a lot worse, people bypass the system of swearing, I myself have been hacked and had very valuable items stolen from my account, expect your kid to ask if they can buy something on this game, it'll eventually happen so make sure you are prepared to spend some money even tho
",6
"A lot of the bad side of the community are kids who are under the age of 10, they tend to do something called ""roleplaying"", a lot of the time it's online dating.
",4
"If you read this and are still planning on having a kid under 10 play this game, I do recommend supervising them, they are not mature enough for games that allow communicating to others.

"i think dis game give me big brain

"lololol 69

",3
"If you're an overprotective parent who came over to Common Sense Media to see if this video game that your child keeps talking about is actually safe, then this review is for you.
",7
"First off, most of the top reviews in the parent's review section were from 2-3 years ago, when Roblox's chat filter wasn't the best.
",1
"I say 99.2% because in a VERY rare situation, some person will use a special character to fill in for a bad word.
",1
"This has only happened to me ONCE in the last 5 years that I have been playing Roblox.
",0
"The reason I say that is because parents were complaining that some games that their child was playing was disgusting, and they couldn't believe that Roblox moderators would allow this type of content.
",0
"You won't find too many of these games anymore, unless you REALLY try to find them.
",8
"Plus, I've never in my life have ever found or played a Roblox game that had ""suggestive"" themes in it.
",0
"Sure, Roblox moderation could be better at taking down games faster and banning people who say naughty things.
",6
"So it's very hard for Roblox moderators to look at every single report they get.
",2
"If you are a parent of a child and want to check if roblox is 
",7
"suitable for your children,it depends,fistly I have to admit that the moderation team is not so great,but on the other hand,can also help your child learn scripting,power his imagination,meet friends and play cool games!
",1
"The game is good, but what’s bad is the community.
",2
"Personally I have no problem with swearing, but there are people who are concerned about it and people find ways to get around tags and swear.
",1
"If your child doesn’t know cuss words then he/she probably won’t know what the missing spaces are (for example: b___h).
",1
"Some people also do sexual stuff, but there isn’t much so I don’t think there is a problem with this so far, but you should warn your kids to not give out their social media, adress and account password because there are scammers.
",7
"Please do note that not the whole community is bad.
",2
"Some games are more violent than others and some can contain explicit content due to immature role-players.
",3
"Just make sure they stay clear of sexual role players and violent games if you say your child is too young or immature to view that content.
",7
"The majority of the games are mediocre at best, but there always are outliers.
",1
"It's Due To Scammers And Rthro Packs.
",0
"Every negative parent review is just them overreacting.
",7
"- And also roblox is not responsible for your kid in any shape or form.
",5
"- And roblox can't moderate their website to your standard.
",5
"It's just impossible concidering that 10-20 people make an account in a minute
",5
"
",0
"I have mostly looked into the game and found a ton of games that can be for 6 - 14 year old children.
",4
"Some have a sprinkle of violence.
",6
"But this is not a game.
",2
"The main reason it is 4/5 rather than 5/5 is because of how sometimes people get bullied, but it happens rarely, nearly never.
",6
"Alright, i believe my other review needs some updating, Roblox is a common target of the media and some parents in general just because people do not parent good and monitor their child or just do not teach their child online safety, Roblox overall is harmless its just some of the exploiters and people who try to bypass the filter who are a problem and btw they do not appear often (Usually games that have not updated anti cheat script), there are a few words that Roblox does not filter like the D---, Bada--
",1
"I also see a lot of bullying happening on roblox.
",2
"I know roblox is doing anything they can to prevent this, but it doesn’t seem to help.
",2
"Sure, it has its flaws, but every game has some problems to them.
",2
"And let me tell you Roblox is proof that online society is rotten.
",4
"Roblox is a platform and people can pretty much upload whatever they want and with anything involving that there is going to be things that are dark and inappropriate.
",1
"People send each other death threats and they curse and they online date.
",9
"When you go into a game you almost always hear ''123 for a bf/gf'' or '' go away noob''.
",7
"People curse and swear nonstop on this website and people hack games all the time!
",9
"I decided to play and it was fun at first but then all of a sudden the sky turned black and heavy metal music started playing and evil messages appeared everywhere.
",0
"And no matter where i turned in the game I saw scary looking faces floating around.
",0
"The game had to be shut down because of hackers.
",0
"Then i went into another game and people were cursing nonstop and they told me that i was a four year old little girl and that i should kill myself.
",0
"New players to the game are labeled noob and are made fun of and you get called ''bacon hair noob'' by ''pros'' who have expensive clothing and accessories.
",1
"There is a lot of profanity on this website and people find ways to bypass the language filter by using numbers or symbols and I have been called very hurtful things on this website and it caused me to become severely depressed.
",1
"And roblox is VERY greedy for money.
",6
"And moderators on the website ignore reports.
",2
"Stay away from roblox because it is a very bad game with a lot of bad mean people on it.
",2
"Keep your kids away from it.
",7
"DO NOT JOIN ROBLOX.
",0
"Roblox's community I can tell you I beg to differ.
",5
"While a majority of it is good, the bad part can be rotten and make you feel like you live in a trash bag.
",1
"Not to mention horny 5 year olds want to get spicy at you every chance they get.
",4
"Also Roblox will never charge you unless it's Robux or a Premium membership.
",6
"""Now i'm not saying there still going to see bad things because people go out of there way to bypass the chat but it will still block numbers, curse words, and other stuff.""
",1
"But please AVOID playing games likes boy and girl hangout or life in paridise, because these games contain severe counts of online predators.
",3
"Like some other kids and even parents that play this game all know a lot of other parents and kids over react about this game over ONE THING!
",4
"ALWAYS bound to be some creepos and swearing but there IS moderation there to delete any pornography and ban or terminate (Perm-Ban) these kinds of people.
",1
"!” And about that there IS chat moderation to hashtag (#) swear words and for kids many ‘bad’ words.
",1
"Though for kids ROBLOX takes it a bit too far to tagging innocent numbers for a question like “How many flags did you get” to a kid and the kid will most likely respond with “###” or “#” when the kid really said “One” or “1” causing kids to be creative in order to say these numbers.
",7
"Because of being user generated, there can be some violence but people just either ragdoll or break apart into pieces as they are like lego people and dont have the blood or gore you might be thinking of.
",3
"Some people CAN make the blood is they want to, but it is usually too much work so the idea is usually dropped.
",2
"However, most of these are violent in a cartoony way.
",3
"Parents shouldn't be able to get mad at ROBLOX itself for a game that involves sex, drinking, or stuff like that.
",6
"However, this also means players have the ability to make games about that stuff, and the moderation is not the best.
",9
"Last time when i was playing roblox my friend sent me a msg if i do want to play a game called ""brutal battle"", i agreed to play with him, i joined him and the game was already brutal, blood, violence, and weapons, and disgusting sounds.
",0
"No matter what happens, do not give your password, that's the ONLY way they can hack you.

"I keep seeing a lot of negative reviews that seem to have incorrect information, so I'm here to try and help.

"A lot of people have said it is inappropriate or violent so I'd like to address that.

"Roblox makes sure players know it's not allowed to online date people.
",7
"As for violence I do agree that some games have some violent gameplay or topics like guns or zombie apocalypses but it's up to you to monitor your child and let them know what not to play.

"There are games where you spend Robux and then what you bought doesn't work but these games are easy to spot out as they are poorly made with not much effort.
",1
"There are also games that ask you to enter your username and password and then the game says it will give you free Robux but it actually steals your account but Roblox deletes those really fast.
",5
"1:If someone says Abc or (123) for a bf or gf or just starts trying to online date DECLINE it because they might do inappropriate stuff or they might be a pedophile.

"Of course there will be reviews saying that ROBLOX is horrible, for many different reasons, but there isn’t much on ROBLOX’s side to blame.

"There is a whole variety of games on ROBLOX, and yes, some do contain violence, but on my experiences with these games, they aren’t very graphic.

"I do have a younger sibling, which does get frustrated at some games, but like any decent parent should do is take charge, and tell them that they aren’t ready for that game, and to switch to something else.

"There aren't any other ones like it.
",8
"Most of the parents who call the game '18+' don't know what they are talking about.
",4
"It wouldn't be their fault if something that the child doesn't like comes on screen.

"My only problem with the game is that sometimes the child will come across 'Robux', and spend the parent's money on this in-game currency.

"4.Moderation

"Moderation is pretty not good in ROBLOX.If you report them there is a really really low change they will get banned.Now this cannot really affect the safety/fun of your child but it is still worth mentioning.If a game is trying to scam people by tricking them into putting their password in and getting their account lost,that game will be banned.

"Now onto the negative stuff.
",3
"The first bad thing is they removed guest!
",6
"(You can still play it on mobile) I don't know why they removed guest but idc (Rip guest 2006 - 2017) The second bad thing is you can bypass the filter very easily!

"Like example f*** you can just say f*** to bypass the filter like comon roblox.
",1
"The third bad thing is the front  page is ""sometimes"" botted by exploiters!
",4
"The fourth and last bad thing is there are alot of exploiters and bugs on roblox!
",2
"They have free exploits, paid exploits like synapse x or spero (does are examples) Which is ILLEGAL on roblox.

"It is great but there is some bad side of roblox too.

"I mean, if you're going to report someone for whatever wrong thing they did, don't expect them to be banned right away.

"There're games that'll try to steal your account and ask for your account password for Robux(game currency), and there are games that'll show pornographical things, but games like those, you can report and ROBLOX will take it down fast.

"If you do something inappropriate, you will be warned, banned for a couple of days, or banned forever.

"cursing, the message would be censored by hashtags (#), which can be annoying, since the system also censors any spelling mistake, or numbers.

"Some people will bully you if you don't have robux or premium (eg.

"calling you a noob), but you should also ignore that since it is quiet harmless.
",7
"There is also 'scam games' (that ask you to put in your password) or scary games (such as Granny or Jeff the Killer), which you should not allow your child to play.
",7
"Also, there are these users that are called online daters, which you should also ignore or report.
",8
"Of course throughout your experience there will be some bad things if there are bad pictures or human genitals it's usually the cause of the fact that you or your child SPECIFICALLY searched for that topic.
",7
"The last thing I will rate is the Consumerism, the prices are quite fair keep in mind this is A FREE game so any of the parents thinking that this game is secretly taking or hacking into your bank account for money it's not.

"I’m a 3 year player and I think Roblox is not what adults think it is.

"The only problem I have with this game is all the scam games and bots.
",2
"The only way to make games on roblox though, is unfortunately on PC.
",2
"Starting with ""Adult Content"", the only way you can get to adult content is if you play shady games or games like Void Script Builder, Next, trolls are in every game, stop saying the game is bad because of them.
",3
"Then, there is cursing, usually it's never a problem except when someone purposely tries to bypass the filter which is when of course when you are playing shady games!

"You don't get banned or scammed from the game for no reason either.
",6
"Gettings banned happens when  you upload or do something wrong on the platform.

"I mean seriously, read the TOS if you are wondering why you've been banned, because, it tells you what is considered wrong to upload or to do.

"Of course hacking happens in every game, but, please if someone is hacking in your game just join a different server.
",7
"Scamming is a yes, there is a lot of people who are trying to scam you.

"The simple solution to this is just don't press on the links that they send you.

"The only real problem of Roblox would be consumerism.

"You can't get any of their currency or makes hats and clothing without ""Premium"".

"- Insane prices charged for in-game items that require website currency to buy.

"No way to get said currency without being able to code if you're not willing to purchase it.
",6
"- Hackers, exploiters, online daters, and plenty of other cheaters, but this mainly depends on what game you're playing.
",2
"- Players can be extremely toxic at times and/or are prone to calling anyone who is better than them in some way a ""noob"" ( a newbie, or person who can't play well, for those who don't know what that means).
",4
"I'd downright say some are flat out cyberbullies.
",6
"The first two or three are fun enough, but it gets stale fast.
",9
"- While improved upon, chat in games is randomly censored for some stupid reason, which can make it hard to communicate with other players.
",1
"- Even the non-clicker, non-grind games tend to get boring enough after you hit 13 or 14.
",5
"If a user can be proven to have violated terms of service to such a high extent, such as hacking, they will be banned for sure.
",1
"I'd suggest just waiting for some events for free clothes/gear, though, as it's not really worth it (in my opinion, anyway) to buy clothes that cost money (especially not player-made ones, as they tend to be extremely overpriced).

"Overall rating: 6.84/10

"Consensus: Trying to find a needle or two, but they're in a haystack, and they are the same color as hay...and without access to a magnet.
",7
"I've seen the parent reviews that say pornographic pictures and videos are being sent on the chat.
",2
"That MUST be fake!
",1
"Roblox does NOT allow videos/ images to be sent in ANY chats.
",6
"The only way for that to happen is by clicking on a link which takes you OUT of the site.

"And if pedos and perverts slide into your DMs?

"You just unfriend them and turn off chat.

"One problem with the game however is that there are people who make bots which are robots and these robots send links to young children that take them to websites that claim to give free robux and all it does is that it will ask for your password and username so it can send you free robux and these are fake instead of getting robux you get hacked.

"A no-brainer at this point, any game that has a community, has hackers, i'd suggest just reporting the player and joining a new server, problem solved.

"Moderation can get clunky.
",5
"Often times, the Moderation System can go out of wack and ban the wrong people or not properly deal with rule breakers, this is mostly due to Roblox using bots to assist moderation, because a team of moderators can't handle thousands of reports every minute, the bots deal with basic stuff like chat filter bypassing pretty well, but other things not so much.

"3.Toxic communities, remember when I talked about how Roblox has plently of communities?

"look Roblox don't let you say numbers unless your 13 then you can say numbers but not to people who are under the age of 13

"also if your afraid of your credit card number being in Roblox hands just buy a Robux gift card its easy

"its very rare to be in a game with a bully or a swearing toxic kid

"also a thing about Robux you can make a good character with out them and for some event you can ge
",1
"Ofcourse they might be rude people but where in the internet and ur children can get exposed to anything.
",7
"As lots of parents/kids have said that the game is littered with swear words, bypasses and sex releated subjects, these are considered to be false.
",1
"Although you could bypass the swear  system, it is almost unrecognizable.
",1
"Roblox Corp. does remove sex related games created by other people as fast as they can as they do not mean to have these games up for children to see, Roblox do not create the games that you child plays.
",1
"A team of developers called 'Badimo' used their robux from a game they made called 'Jailbreak' and converted it in to real life money.
",0
"If you look at the other reviews of ROBLOX on this website, you might not be too pleased with the reviews and not let your child play.
",7
"Those reviews just see the bad side of it.
",2
"I have seen my fair share of profane and rude players, but for the most part it’s just friendly kids hoping for a pleasant video game experience.
",1
"Other then the chat system.... that's the main focus of why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5, the chat system is getting badder and tagging more words every single day it seems like soon enough, the whole English and Spanish and other languages will be tagged out....
",1
"Although  they might have a lot of spammers, exploiters, and toxic people, but there is always gonna be that one kid who will ruin the experience, that's why they have report systems and all that, if you even feel like it, join a diffrent server.
",2
"Now admittedly at this point of Roblox they didn’t have all that good chat filtering and reporting systems but I still experienced some weird stuff.
",2
"I learned about a lot of stuff children should NOT know.
",7
"I know that servers used to be hacked constantly and hackers would post disturbing images or nude pics.
",8
"Not to mention the pedophiles on the site that I was too stupid of a kid to know about but looking back they said a lot of weird stuff.
",0
"Honestly Roblox should be for teenagers only.
",4
"Roblox is not a game.
",3
"This is something most of my friends (and most people in general) do not understand.
",0
"The problem is, like every community, not everyone is friendly.
",2
"In Roblox there some aggressive players who will sometiems approach you and make fun of you, or people who will just give you a bad time in general.
",5
"But that's not it.
",7
"There are coutnless scammers, scam bots (automated accounts that will try to get your account hacked) and you can very rarely encounter a pedophile (I've not encountered one in four years).
",5
"There are some horror games that usually contain blood or other thigns inappropriate for children bellow the age of 13. there are also, sadly inappropriate games and scam games, such as games containing sex or games that will get your account hacked.
",1
"I am sorry for any spelling errors or bad grammar but I am not English.
",3
"Unfortunately there are a lot of Robux-only things, however they're not necessary to enjoy the game.
",8
"Most of these reviews are very old it seems, as ROBLOX is very nudity-free and swear free and i haven't seen stuff like they describe in over 8 years of playing ROBLOX.
",1
"I've been playing Roblox since 2013 and I recently quit the game because my account was deleted for something I didn't even do.
",0
"I spent over $300 and the admins do not care and rejected my appeal saying I was correctly terminated.
",9
"I am done with this game and I have moved on from it.
",7
"To anyone currently playing the game, I advise you to NOT purchase any Robux, or BC, even if you don't like how your current avatar looks.
",5
"Now this may not be good for your kid if he has never ever been exposed to any form of blood or virtual death and taught its fake, but its a pretty good game if you can handle it, there are some  bad games on it such as the Condo but the entire game isnt bad some games have blood and death but thats all, and if you have safe chat cuss words willl be tagged out unless sombody by passes it some way.
",2
"The players also may bully you if you use an avatar that looks like you play on games with ODers or online daters.
",3
"Which if you are reading this and decided to play roblox these are scams.
",7
"Adults are overreacting that roblox is an explicit place.
",2
"so when I was playing this game yesterday I was playing some rap battle game, when I was playing this game some random guy started cussing it was a weird font so it didn't block it, I told him to stop but he really didn't I tried reporting him but I know that never does anything, and he kept cussing and im pretty sure there was some little kids in the game asking their parents what those meant and started repeating them, and probably getting into trouble.
",0
"so if your child asks for this app and they are under the age of hmmmmm 9/10 I think you should probably say no.
",7
"These people get banned very quickly.
",1
"Some of the games have bad things in it, but get taken down quickly too.
",8
"Parents should watch over their kids when they are playing Roblox if something goes wrong, such as somebody swearing.
",7
"However, the most annoying thing for under 13 users is probably safechat.
",4
"It also blocks numbers, and might block words like ""ok"" for no actual reason.
",1
"It even blocks out my Name, which is Kinda rude.
",1
"There is also groups that require you to not have safechat/Be over 13 which is unfair, since Roblox is for any age.
",6
"There might also be ""Rich"" people (Usually people who have a lot of Robux) bullying new players or as they call them ""noobs"" which basically means a new player but sometimes in a rude way.
",1
"There are some games where online dating is basically a trend, but most of the Online Daters are getting banned from the games, however, not from Roblox.
",2
"I think today you need to spend a lot of money on Roblox to kinda be satisfied, they take 3% of every time you buy stuff, or donate to someone, they also made Robux more expensive.
",7
"this is defintly no kid's game.
",5
"Language is mild: the only ones are: d**n, sucker, doum, etc.
",2
"A few points to consider before you are brainwashed by reviews that only make you turn to other games:
",5
"
",0
"1) The parents never mention that there is an easy way to prevent disgusting behaviour and swearing.
",2
"2) There is just downright slanderous information.
",8
"Roblox is against Robux Generators (which are scams by the way).
",8
"They can have viruses, but not the Roblox Player!
",2
"I have a virus!""
",6
"just to defame the game.
",6
"Lemme guess, just wanna defame Roblox.
",6
"Kids do not equal fools.
",3
"a) That is most probably fake
",9
"           b) Even if he did, you should have monitored your child
",7
"
",0
"All in all, great game!
",2
"There has been some games that are violent, there are chat filtering.
",1
"If you don't want your child changing their account settings, or want to lock it.
",7
"But some people make fun of people because they have no robux,kids want robux but you have to pay.
",7
"Sometimes it asks you to buy stuff with money which is a little annoying.
",7
"I am 13 and when I was 10, I saw people having $ex in Roblox and I just straight up quit.
",0
"I came back and they banned the word ""something.""
",0
"Also, somebody called me a ""female dog,"" but the curse word.
",0
"If I had to complain, Robux is ""required"" in order to get stuff on the website.
",0
"This is bad for kids who's parents don't give them money for the game.
",7
"Though through the years of its development, some older and more mature players who began to script and build some very inappropriate content, which with some of the hacks players made it have discovered, has led to some parents suddenly concerned for their child's safety and their eyes.
",1
"I
",0
"
",0
"can tell you this, if you don't want your kid to see a pink dick as a weapon, then monitor on what they play.
",7
"There are a bunch of OD'ers (we call them Online Daters) that somehow find those sexual games and get into it.
",4
"Some games may have ""18+"" or ""13+"" in the name but ignore that, usually that is false.
",1
"The content that sometimes is shown is all caused by talented scripters who wedge their creations into the game and 
",1
"the language is somehow bypassed.
",1
"if you dont buy any robux i have seen people who did not buy anything and are getting bullied.
",6
"also there is online dating and cursing.
",8
"ROBLOX blocks swear words fine, but some people manage to find ways to swear.
",1
"If you're worried about your kids finding or saying rude things you should disable their ability to chat to others in settings.
",7
"Note that some games try to overprice their gamepasses which means you can buy your kids $30 worth of ROBUX and they waste it on something that they don't even want.
",6
"As far as safety goes, some games allow players to have admin which means they can change the 'Decal' which are pictures on walls to something absolutely disgusting (Pornographic photos) I, myself have experienced this once and never want to again, if you are worried your child will see something like this, make sure they only play games from the ""Games"" section and not search anything up.
",7
"Another problem I have found is hackers, some games can easily be hacked and can do things such as Pornographic Actions.
",1
"There are also many ROBLOX Trolls, many teenagers try to take advantage of children and trick them into doing something or even donating their in-game currency to them.
",9
"That's all I have to say to all the parents getting mad at roblox it's not there fault for you not teaching your kid right and wrong!
",7
"I believe that Roblox does have flaws but everything has flaws.
",2
"I am growing up with Roblox’s moderation isn’t the best but you shouldn’t judge Roblox until you have seen the full thing.
",5
"I've seen many bad reviews on this website regarding this game.
",2
"However, many of these reviews have points that are super outdated, have been fixed, or are just... terrible.
",2
"Now, I don't know where to start.
",8
"One of the biggest faults for younger players is parents not being responsible for their childs actions on the game.
",4
"Many people complain about the moderators not working hard enough, but you need to remember that those people have lives to, so they cant just stay up 24/7 reading around 1000+ reports every day.
",2
"yes it is a community created game (which means the players create the games/content) so there will always be some kids creating bad things, But the Roblox banning system if fast for that purpose.
",1
"one instance that happened to me was that i was playing an obstacle course game and it shut down saying it had been updated.
",0
"I then re joined the game to see inappropriate stuff everywhere but only 10 seconds after i joined the game had been removed.
",0
"it may look harmless but its NOT.
",1
"child predators and little kids turned into online daters.
",7
"But some things in this game is oof innapropiate.
",2
"And robock cost a lot of money.
",9
"The chat system needs some work to.
",1
"Also alot of the games are violent.
",3
"I HATE ODER ON MEEPCITY THEY MIGHT BE YOUNG TO DATE IF I SEE SOMEONE DATE AGIAN I WILL CONTACT ROBLOX
",0
"Unless your kid goes out of there way to see sexual content, There wont be any.
",7
"Everyone saying they saw these types of games or images wasn't watching their child enough clearly, Because you cant play any games that even have the possibility of players exploiting them to put sexual content in game UNLESS when signing up, The kid put their information as over 13.
",3
"The only thing that could possibly happen is 2 players  ""online dating"", which can easily be prevented if the guardian would watch the kid when they set up the account.
",7
"The way the game is portrayed is very unfair.
",2
"Somebody hacked into her account and used her information to take the stuff we bought for her.
",0
"Roblox said they wouldn’t do anything and we got no help.
",0
"The workers are no help and the game has a lot of grown adults playing, I wouldn’t recommend using it.
",3
"There are some problems though.
",3
"Online Daters: ODers aren’t that bad only if they go TOO far.
",7
"Bullies: There are bullies but just don’t take them seriously, they’re pathetic losers.
",9
"Scams: DONT TRUST ANY LINKS.
",0
"Swearing: Monitor your kids once in a while to see if they are doing bad stuff.
",7
"ROBUX is extremely overpriced, and everything costs ROBUX nowadays.
",6
"The chat system is easy to be overridden too and ROBLOX hates it when the users speak out against it.
",4
"Some games are scams for free robux (NEVER give ur password OR go to the website).
",5
"The bots are going worse and worse.
",8
"However, it does have its weak points.

"The filter is EXTREMELY overprotective, if you have a

"Surviving Roblox 101... you really can’t

"
",0
"In this review, I’m not talking about bloody and violent games (though that’s something to consider).
",3
"I’m talking about Roblox’s biggest problem: its players.
",9
"Take it from me: any kid is better off not being on Roblox.
",4
"The community is horrible.
",2
"Most of the toxic people in there can be, well, actually are divided into groups:
",2
"
",0
"(You might think I’m exaggerating, but these kids you can typically find in roleplay games, shooters... basically any popular game on the front page.
",8
"Trolls: Kids, big and small, who bully for the fun of it.
",2
"Easy to avoid if your kid knows how to responsibly deal with a bully, which, from my experience, they won’t.
",7
"Many times I’ve had to intervene in a fight, started with the same formula: A- You’re (something insulting)!
",5
"B- You’re (something insulting), too!
",0
"Instead of the victim just ignoring and blocking/muting their bully, they’ll throw back the same insults.
",9
"Scammers/Hackers: There was once a free currency in the game called TIX.
",0
"You could buy yourselves clothes with this, make your avatar nicer, until one day, and all too soon, it was removed and replaced completely by Robux, which you have to pay for.
",0
"The natural greed for free Robux came and scam bots and sites became much more common.
",8
"If you’re heading into Roblox, don’t trust anything that promises free Robux.
",8
"They’ll most likely steal your account.
",7
"Hackers are more or less the same, but also corrupt games on Roblox.
",8
"You’d expect there to be few ODers, only horny teens and pedophiles, but this isn’t always the case.
",2
"The scariest part of Roblox for a parent, might be that ODers mainly consist of the children themselves, with the herd mentality that saying “ABC for a boy/girlfriend” and humping each other is fun.
",3
"Let me tell you: it doesn’t work.
",0
"Curse words and even numbers can get through, not directly, but they can.
",1
"Another thing: reporting isn’t helpful.
",2
"Most of these reports are sent in by kids.
",2
"They can be lies or they can be truths, but at the end of the few weeks taken for the whoever to read them, what is there left to do?
",2
"I’ve been reported dozens of times for legitimate reasons when I was being a bully myself when I was younger and I never got punished.
",0
"If I haven’t described the people of Roblox enough, let me make it a little scarier:
",9
"
",0
"Roblox doesn’t hold your hand.
",8
"At least the safe chat and report system doesn’t.
",1
"Everybody is toxic.
",2
"Full-blown arguments can stem from a kid laughing that “I have Robux, but you’re poor!” or “You look like a noob!” As we’ve already established, these kids don’t know how to handle bullies and so they might become one themselves.
",1
"Racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, it all exists here.
",8
"So once again, if you want to preserve your kid’s good nature, either remove Roblox from all devices or send them in, not able to chat and with caution.
",8
"Dang it, this game makes me feel like a soldier constantly on a battlefield.
",4
"At this point, I’m only playing to stop bullies and look at updates.
",7
"People need to chill about this not being safe for kids.
",3
"If you dont want your child part of the social aspect of it all turn off chat.
",7
"Most swearing is censored out so dont worry about that and reporting is easy if someone makes up a replacement word or bullies you.
",2
"Some games are violent but you can choose whether your kid plays those games and roblox is always getting rid of games that are inappropriate.
",3
"I dont recommend friending people you dont know because they can fake and bully.
",4
"Roblox has horrible moderation systems and i find too much naked body parts on Roblox.
",1
"Reports dont work, People swear too much, Everything is too expensive, and too much drugs.
",1
"I played ROBLOX myself and it is very bad and it is full of sexual content,violence,war and cyberbullyes.The moderation in this game is very,very bad and you can get banned easily for doing what is in other multiplayer games just fine.You CANNOT CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT so that means that there is no way to delete your ROBLOX account in ANY way possible.DO NOT PLAY UNLESS YOU ARE ABOVE 18 YEARS OLD!!!!!
",1
"The moderation is horrible.
",2
"You can hardly say Any words and yet is is easy to bypass.
",1
"They're also money cows as it costs money to do almost anything.
",6
"They let people freely bully and harass others and thats just the tip of the iceberg.
",8
"It's sad because this game has the potential to become a masterpiece.
",4
"Some people do exaggerate in their reviews.
",3
"Roblox is a great platform for games, until you have to buy robux, get censored in chat and meet ODers.
",1
"Roblox has also taken away events.
",9
"And put Rthro in that it scares me what this game could become.
",0
"I love Roblox, but they better do something before they meet their downfall.
",7
"The children can't find any ""innapropriate"" items unless they search for it, but due to the high chat restrictions for users under the age of 13.
",1
"Sometimes trollers will go to those contents, but the children would most likely would not understand.
",7
"I tested this in a private server (nobody can join unless invited) with my friends and the kind of swears you can get by replacing letters with symbols is pretty bad for a game that's advertised for children.
",1
"Games are sometimes violent, a minor amount with round red puddles meant to look like blood, but this is rare as it actually requires developing skill.
",1
"Now to all these people claiming things like ""my child's character was raped"" and ""there's strip clubs in roblox"" you are wrong.
",4
"Roblox has succeeded in removing strip clubs from the site, but they can't control a players actions unless they were reported by multiple people.
",0
"I'd stay out of the roleplaying stuff (adopt and raise, wolves life, etc) because that's where most of the people trolling and working their way around the filtration system hang out in my experience.
",8
"I wouldn't recommend this game for kids under the age of 12, although if your kid is smart enough to know what to not share with strangers and just have common sense they should be fine.
",7
"Majority of so called ""ODers"" aren't Oders at all.
",0
"After they leave the game, you don't talk to that player again.
",7
"Well to start Roblox in general, there is TONS of games (over 200k) while most of them are bad games, (I'm not going to count the tons of fake, starter, and copied games) There are a few gems in the bunch.
",9
"DO NOT LET THEM PLAY SIMULATORS
",0
"      Unless you can find the 2 GOOD simulator games that I've searched for weeks for, you should really keep them away, they drain time away, and are pay to win, Most have items in-game that cost OVER $25
",5
"
",0
"Chat and player interaction, The chat system is pretty much broken for anyone with an account that is set to age 12 or under as it censors random words and makes chatting in general near impossible (no numbers without knowing the super secret totally not hard to find code 
",1
"It’s over censored and everyone complained about it it censors 99.9% of mean messages occasionally they get threw but there is absolutely no way to say curse words or other bad words.
",1
"Stupid, idiot, and dummy might get threw but most of the time not.
",5
"The violence truly isn’t that bad, it’s like a lego being dissembled.
",2
"And it makes an OOF sound when you die.
",6
"So you do need to be careful about this.
",7
"Another issue with the chat is there are a lot of bot accounts.
",1
"This is obviously a scam, so you need to make sure your child is savvy enough before letting them play this game.
",7
"It’s a great game, but some things are bad.
",2
"And also DO NOT ENGAGE IN THE ACTIVITY KNOWN AS ONLINE DATING!
",8
"This can be potentially dangerous, and you never know who’s on the other side.
",4
"Oh, and stay away from Meepcity parties and Meepcity in general, that’s where all the shady stuff happen.
",4
"Users sometimes create games with inappropriate, but Roblox is quick to ban the user as well as the game.
",1
"Also, some users do inappropriate things in the game, but Roblox will ban them.
",1
"Roblox also has a very annoying censor system.
",1
"It's actually quite annoying as if I even misspell a word, it well censor it.
",1
"Also, it's not Roblox's fault that your children are stealing your credit cards to buy things off Roblox.
",7
"I know people have put gross pictures on walls on F3X but that does rarely happen anymore.
",2
"Not even pedophiles.
",1
"Most of the games have a dark secret whether it be a link to a porn site or other things.
",8
"Some of the games are just porn and abuse where any kid might accidentally find a porn game because there is an ad for free robux and when they join it's porn.
",8
"The moderators do nothing about people saying that they want to smash you (In a sexual way) .
",7
"Also the purchase for game passes are mostly a scam and when you ask roblox to refund it because it's against the law(You can read the law and clearly find a rule that says the misconception and scamming is a jailable offence) and the fact that they won't even give you any robux back
",0
"even if you have proof is just unacceptable.
",9
"every time i watch a news report talk about the insecurities of roblox, i always need to take a stupidity break.
",7
"so..some parents rate roblox 18+ i have seen, i will give some advise...put them on minus 13 mode if you want to avoid nsfw stuff..
",7
"there are idiots that make sex games and etc yeah, there are violent games too (wich don't increase your kids violence unless they are a certain type i think but they don't increase violence in kids though) 
",3
"however roblox wasn't made for that it was made with a child friendly community in mind wich to this day is still largely present.
",0
"I like how they censor numbers so you cant tell age and stuff, but by now its so easy to bypass stuff, I don't like how they censor spelling mistakes though.
",1
"I had a group based on my game adopt a kid have a family live rich enjoy life (dont judge me) and i got innapropiate comments on it once.. i deleted them.
",0
"I played for a while it was ok but now its unplayable with the bug 610 I cant play ever again
",0
"It is very fun at the start, but eventually, you run out of games to play and Roblox can get boring as heck.
",3
"Sometimes, I begin to think that some of these players work for Roblox, and make them feel ugly so they buy Robux and Roblox just gets more money.
",3
"I woudn't really bother with this game.
",3
"You also need to download it to play, and I deleted it some time ago because I need more space on my computer, and that trash of a game took alot of space.
",0
"I will never download Roblox again, even if my Roblox obsessed friend BEGS me.
",0
"Go get another game, because Roblox is TRASH.
",9
"First of all, these messages saying ""ROBLOX is bad do not let your child play it"" Are fake.
",7
"These are people who go to the darkest places of ROBLOX that are not monitored because thousands get created in seconds.
",4
"Even though some bots delete these games.
",3
"All video games have a dark side.
",8
"Heck, even google has a dark side where you can buy drugs.
",2
"Then you instantly leave the game.
",5
"Now back to topic) So, if you really hated that game just tell your child not to play that specific game on ROBLOX and play something like ""Be a Kitten and Grow up"" or anything your child thinks would be cute.
",7
"(Make sure they don't swear if you are a over-protective, overreacting dumb parent).
",7
"Children both ways will have to learn swear words to tell your (maybe) future grandkids to not use these swear words.
",4
"Don't believe these Overreacting parents.
",4
"While people will always find a way to swear evade, there will always be people who tend to bypass chat filters regardless of the effort put into stop it, so if you’re more concerned over swearing or personal questions, you can disable chat with other people.
",1
"My issues with ROBLOX as it stands currently; The removal of the forums, the limits of posting in the developer forums, the sites’ and studios’  updates breaking some of the games and scripts, the filter censoring out harmless words and numbers, the removal of safe chat, as well as the removal of TIX and the overall “pay to play” concept the site seems to exploit.
",9
"The removal made little sense to me.
",9
"If any issues, post count, bots and spam would’ve been removed.
",5
"While the filter has improved with blocking out many swears and generally unwanted words, it also has a tendency to backfire, allowing users to bypass certain words with certain fonts, ways of spelling, etc.
",1
"It also censors out normal words that others have exploited into sexual context.
",1
"However, a majority of these tend to either scam you, or hack into your computer and your account.
",5
"They can keylog, steal private information, and even worse, important passwords and credit card info.
",5
"The concept of protecting your child over everything will make them rely on a parental figure for the rest of their lives, and struggle to find things out for themselves.
",6
"ROBLOX has to much swearing,online dating,hackers,scammers,off-site links,cyber bullies, and more.
",2
"However if you change the parental control settings then it gets better: you can turn chat off and block users and turn certain settings off (join game,friends,chat,ect) ROBLOX has much violence and it is concerning if your child(children) are playing and are under the age of 14 because this game is nit appropriate for kids unless you turn on parental controls.
",7
"Most of the games are good natured and harmless but the people playing the games are sometimes harmful.
",1
"In app purchases are also a problem-kids buy all of this robux and builder’s club without permission from their parents and then their parents ban them from playing roblox.
",6
"The roblox world is now falling apart.
",2
"People are breaking the rules and now adults are playing trying to spam/scam/steal info from kids.
",4
"I've encountered many with my siblings and it was not fun.
",0
"Now it makes me worry about those who are younger and play this game.
",4
"And with bullying.
",1
"I've honestly seen so many bullies in this game that it frustrates me on how children are nowadays.
",3
"I don't know how Roblox fixes issues of bullying but I want it fixed.
",6
"I rather see my siblings happy not crying because they got bullied in a game.
",0
"I know most parents wouldn't want that happening to their child either.
",7
"I know most kids are gonna be very biased and say this app is great but parents please understand that bullying does happen and along with dating and flirting.
",4
"A lot of adult ratings have a rating 18+ but these are just stupid reviews that don't make sense like someone saying noob is bad for them like noob is not a swear word the only swear word in this game is hell but this is not big of a swear word.

"If you don't trust your child or are worried about your child in Roblox I would suggest monitoring them or talking to them about what could happen if they don't make smart choices while playing and interacting with other users.

"Roblox has a chat filter which will prevent your child from seeing and saying certain words and numbers.

"Remember those crummy individuals?

"They also enjoy HACKING games on Roblox, just to look cool, or earn extra (fake) money in game.
",6
"Little kids, even kids of my age, are influenced by such hackers.
",8
"These hackers try to convince other players that hacking is the way to go, and soon enough, more hackers.

"As a teen, I get bored easily.
",6
"Clever name, but faulty system.
",4
"They get more greedy (shocker)!

"Their customer service is crappy.

"(Shocker, again)
",0
"They issue a report system for each game, designed to track down hackers, badmouthed children, and bullies.
",8
"They pride themselves on the system, saying that it can ban folks in a matter of a day or less.
",5
"Why is that I report a hacker, and a few days later, they’re still hacking on the SAME game?
",6
"I broke one of their “community rules,” got reported, and nothing happened.

"NOTHING.

"With the way they space out their profit system, I would have had to pay $15 out of pocket to simply change my username.

"With all of the other players bringing the company probably 1 million a week, why is it that they still ponder for money out of the hands of children and their parents?
",9
"I don’t have $15.

"The “Customer Care” doesn’t give a crap about you or your child.

"If they continue ignoring hackers, their game will go down the drain, taking your invested money with it.

"Do yourselves a favor and do NOT allow yourself or your child to feed this corporation any further.
",7
"There is too much violence in some games.
",2
"Sometimes there is too much swearing by real life people in messages.
",1
"Why would people complain about child predators on Roblox, in reality its just 12 year olds using their avatars to get a gf and pretend to do something with their life, like obviously parents.
",4
"The chance of the other person being a predator is 0.01%, Like come on people.
",9
"Points: Exploiters, Sexual stuff, bullies and stuff, scammers, violence and consumerism.
",3
"Exploiters: Yes, exploiters are pretty bad.
",2
"They can make a child feel upset after they've worked so hard in a game only for an exploiter to auto-reset them.
",6
"Exploiting is something not easy to stop.
",5
"Once FilteringEnabled was forced onto all games, it has now become a LOT harder to exploit nudity and inappropriate stuff into a game.
",0
"Sexual Things: Up to ODers, most people who ""pertend"" to date are just more young kids.
",4
"The chances of an ODer atually being a predator is VERY slim; about a 0.01% chance of finding.
",8
"Images CANNOT be sent through Roblox chats at all.
",7
"I have never seen someone post a pic of porn somewhere or pertend to ""have sex"".
",4
"Bullies: This is something that is not related to Roblox.
",5
"This is found EVERYWHERE on the internet.
",1
"If you are worried about bullies, go to your child account's settings and disable their ability the chat or see chat in-game.
",7
"This way, they will never know if they are being bullied.
",7
"Too many parents ignore these excellent privacy features.
",2
"The filter however is probably the reason for the missing star.
",6
"the worst things are the annoying 2-year-olds and the chat filter (though if you are concerned about your kids talking to people on the internet you could just turn the chat off).
",7
"If you think kids shouldn't be online at all!
",7
"Ok to start take a look at the parental controls there is no option 
",1
"to stop your kid from friending strangers.
",4
"Secondly there are
",8
"... drug dealing games and naked avatars.
",1
"Mild gun violence presented in a cartoonish 
",3
"way.
",0
"I have played this game for around 7 years now, and all I need to say is, this game was never intent to have adult content, nor does it promote harassment, bullying, etc.
",2
"The big idea is that while yes, there are games that are very inappropriate, those games are very hard to find, and either way, parents should be monitoring what their kids do on games like Roblox, since it's online, and allows socialization with other kids above their age.
",8
"The number one complaint I see is that this game is not meant for kids, and shouldn't be allowed for them.
",4
"There are games out there that sound incredibly nice to play, but some of the players aren't 10 or 12, they could be 17, which invokes inappropriate content.
",1
"It's not the game that inducing this, it's definitely the players.
",4
"Another complaint is that this game allows adults to have inappropriate meetings with children.
",7
"If there are people who want to do inappropriate actions with kids, that is a very, very small chance and if it is happening, block them, even if the kid doesn't want you to.
",7
"The swear filter on this game is terrible.
",1
"Mainly, it doesn't do the correct job that it's trying to do.
",6
"There ARE some violent games and toxic people, but come on.
",3
"If you don't want your kids learning bad stuff or talking to strangers, you can set account restrcitions so they can't play violent games and can't talk to people.
",7
"the safe chat sucks.I mean, this is even more terrible then totalitarianism that I just type something like asdjflkjdl;fja;sldfjl;asdjf;ls and they HASHTAGED IT!!!!
",9
"and you can't say 1234567890 too!!!
",2
"That's absolutely terrible...... Also the games are copying other games outside and roblox didn't even mind!!
",8
"2016 was pretty good as well , 2017 started to get really edgy and 2018, I lost all hope for the platform at that time.
",0
"Those games are GONE because roblox messed up the filtering capabilities of their scripts and copyrighted lots of audio files.
",2
"But listen, is ROBLOX really that bad of a platform?
",2
"My final verdict, ROBLOX is good and bad at the same time.
",9
"I can't even with these grown-ups and their dumb reviews.
",9
"It's YOUR fault you are raising your kid poorly.
",2
"Stop blaming apps all the time that they're supposed to moderate your child for you all the time.
",7
"Yes people cuss, so this is what I'm saying, YOUR KID HAS TO BE MATURE IF YOU WANT THEM TO FULLY ENJOY THIS.
",2
"Your kid is probably stupid that they are sharing their information on the site or just being immature and dumb.
",7
"Parents need to blame themselves for this.
",7
"The only bad thing about roblox is just there making descions that make people mad but you can just ignore it and play games!
",3
"Is dangerous for children under 12 or for children that their not know how to lrotect themselves in internet.
",4
"When everyone is allowed to speak their mind and no one knows who they really are...things get rough
",1
"Sometimes toxic community but ok
",2
"However, I wouldn't recommend it for children 7 and under.
",4
"First of all, when you create an account, children can quite easily fake their age and end up with a 13+ account.
",7
"This is not good.
",3
"Second of all, there are many scams, as you've probably heard, of 'free robux' and the like.
",1
"Do not fall for this.
",3
"There is NO such thing as 'free robux'.
",1
"The developers will hack your account, by using a website or page that looks similar to Roblox's official page.
",5
"They will ask you to log in, and there you go: You've gotten hacked.
",5
"There are also bots that promote these sites.
",8
"Do NOT ever go in there.
",5
"Thirdly, there are some games...not suitable for young children that Roblox has allowed.
",4
"The deaths are cartoonish, and it's easy to win.
",3
"It's useless and mainly used for in-game cosmetics, as well as the robux packages being insanely overpriced.
",6
"so i love playing roblox but some times like today i went on and it said i had no internet but i did it was annoying so i just kept trying then after 30 minutes of trying to bet on i gave up
",0
"Okay gotta admit the moderation pretty much is bad but Roblox is a great platform for many stuff.
",2
"It is a nice platform to do things but there are sketchy users.
",8
"Like in any other online multiplayer game there will always be some sketchy guys.
",1
"There are hackers, online daters, and straight up weird idiots.
",2
"But in roblox, there is a report system but it may be flawed in a few ways.
",1
"There is a such thing as the blocking system,  it allows users to block someone ans in result they will never see them again.
",1
"They can't chat with them, they can't join them in games.
",7
"Also against the Terms Of Service (ToS) of Roblox, (which you should read) and can be deleted quickly, alright, great messages, creativity, imagination, and learning expiriences on building, physics, and other things.
",9
"There is some violence in some of the games but you should avoid them if you can't handle it.
",3
"In the actual game you have a variety of options, unfortunately some people pass the filtering system and use codes like “wanna d8” luckily you can report those kinds of people and the mods will handle it.
",1
"As for the violence you just have to monitor you child’s computer.
",7
"The games are made by separate users and of course there's going to be horny 16 year olds losing their Lego virginity on 'The Streets' while blasting bypassed audios on their 400 robux boombox.
",6
"um well u see this game is very bad bebcuase i get rpaed by kiddies on the website one guy said ""despacito"" and he had taht spider rbolox skin then brkoe into my huose and rpaed me don't play this game epic bad
",2
"""There are bullies"": Just ignore them.

"""There is violence"": Ok.

"You can't just hide him/her from violence.

"""There are online daters"": Ignore them.

",1
"I don't really have a childhood because of roblox.
",9
"Also ""ODERS"" Roblox Online daters are destroying roblox.
",2
"But one more thing roblox instead of  fixing the ODER problem they make the chat STRICTER!You can't even say one Horrible!
",7
"I'm not saying that those games should NOT be popular, I'm just trying to say that its just getting more boring since almost every popular games are not original.
",3
"I’ve been playing for almost 5 years now and have only ever experienced one person ask to “rape” my character and I said no and blocked the person super easy to change passwords on your account if you get scammed there is a game called murder mystery which is animated in where you either run away from the murderer or try and kill the murderer as the sheriff or be the murderer just don’t let your kids play games like this (murderer mystery, Assasin, zombie attach etc.)
",3
"As a parent, you can not moderate your own child’s account.
",5
"Back to moderation, moderators have given bans for unfair reasons before, and others may let a image containing disturbing content to slip through.
",2
"One last thing to mention is the hacker/exploiter problem.
",4
"People will try to find ways to use hacks in game.
",1
"It should be noted that news reports are not always the best source for info regarding this game.
",6
"I wouldn't give it a 100% BEST review because it's so cringy at a time.
",0
"The reason I would like to report this is because a lot of people get bullied for doing nothing!
",2
"QwQ And it makes some people cry especially if they're yalls little darlins' who yall soccer mom's care so much 'bout.
",7
"Honestly, I don't get it.
",5
"You parents are acting like ""Roblox""can put your child in ""danger"" when it's honestly just 12 year old kids looking for a virtual girlfriend.
",7
"Bots exist just for the reason to spam your messages, but you ignore them.
",7
"And if any inappropriate games are uploaded onto Roblox the moderators remove it within an hour or so.
",2
"To all the people who think this is money wasting, how do you think a company with $0 of currency could keep a site up with billions of users logging in everyday?
",2
"As the media keeps on slandering Roblox just for the sake of the clicks, I just think parents don't even know a thing about Roblox.
",2
"As the various item ""gears"" have a violent type of items, none have anything violent but to making players body parts fall off and make them disappear.
",3
"1- The filtering system is a mess.
",1
"You can't even say a sentence without it getting tagged.
",3
"2- The moderators are bots and ban people who aren't doing anything.
",2
"3- The media slandering Roblox, forcing the game to be more terrible, just for the sake of the medias leaving them alone.

"It's Also kind of keeps youtubers playing it when they barley have video concept that they have or they just wanna play games.
",3
"They also have the safety chat so people can't swear but there are still bullies.

"I hate Roblox, ever since Minecraft came in Roblox hasn't been able to be a good game, it used to be the most famous game in the world, but games that had people who cared a lot for the players came in (like Minecraft) Roblox has been hated, sure the games are fun, but you have to pay for everything, I counted and you need to pay more the $100 dollars in Robux to play in servers!

"And to this day there is still a large number of bugs in the game, and for the games that you don't have to pay, some of them are deleted!

"I made Roblox made “cond” and “condo” of these words gone but the word Con is hard to hashtag it.

"PLEASE BAN THE CONDO GAMES PLEASE!

"Before you go make a crappy rating because you both are over reacting please read this.
",7
"Roblox Sometimes will have pedophiles or teens or someone doing sex with people and all.
",1
"and sometimes scammers from russia or whatever scam and hack into accounts.
",3
"Roblox currently is boring and repetitive (I’ve been playing the same games for two years please help).
",9
"Usually the staff just completely ignores the community’s opinions.
",9
"The game’s reputation is so bad that I bet if you yell out that you play Roblox out in public people are going to give you a weird look.
",6
"Sure Roblox does allow its users to “create” games which will rarely ever be played and are shamed by the community and other actual developers.
",9
"But besides that the staff treats developers of their game as well you know, garbage!
",6
"And on top of that there’s also sexual activity, harassment, swearing, and even more “great” that the game has to offer!
",8
"You get your account removed!
",5
"But nope, not anymore now you gotta whip out the credit card for this game if you want literally anything.
",7
"This causes people to try to steal your child’s account by promising in game cash in return of your child’s password to his/her account.
",5
"These activities go against the rules of Roblox which can go from cheating to online dating.
",8
"Oh don’t even get me started on the community itself!
",0
"Nowadays the players in the game are just...well it’s a little bit complicated to explain.
",2
"So you have players that hilariously have horrible grammar and spelling.
",8
"But on the other hand you have players that are just outright mean and will most likely bully your child.
",2
"If you still consider letting your child play this game (which you shouldn’t) be sure to monitor his/her actions.

"Now while I agree with some stuff overall I don't think it's as bad as everyone makes it out to be.

"that have violence.

"CHAT:
",0
"Again it's true the community is pretty toxic.
",2
"Now once in a while people find workarounds between bad stuff but usually they get tagged by 2 weeks.

"You should know it sometimes gets addicting and if that happens you need to stop your child.

"why do you even want to say that in a kid friendly game????
",7
"the in game chat filter sucks  many times i just want a normal conversation it just covers up random words

",6
"report was send=>report arrive at moderater=moderater cant read cause they are bots=>report denied

"So you problably have seen many soccer moms trying to give roblox a bad rating right?
",6
"Well let me give you a brief timeline ive been, assaulted, seen somebdy be se***** assaulted or smoke and drink.
",1
"The chance of anything bad happening to your child is a 0.5%.
",7
"Yes you should moderate your kids because its not robloxs fault your little soccer child got assaulted.

"They dont babysit your kids.

"If your kid gets assaulted or anything its your own fault.
",3
"Unless you are super sensitive and dont let your kids even play ""Zoo tycoon!
",7
"There may be an inappropriate game every now and then, but roblox is quick to ban the game and the user who made it.
",2
"People can't send pictures on roblox, and sexual talk or bad words are always censored.
",1
"There may be scammers to get free robux, and they can send links to bad websites that may steal your kid's account, or put a virus on their device.
",5
"Overall, roblox is a good kid friendly game with the occasional bad occurrence, but roblox is quick to get rid of it.
",2
"A lot of online dating and cyber bullying.
",2
"Honestly disgusting, the game itself is kid friendly, but the people on it are dangerous.
",3
"Its good but roblox is greedy.

"Sorry for the bad formatting i wrote tyis on my tablet

"But there are people doing s*x to kids' characters.

"Don't let your kid play role play games.

"Don't play this game!

"I spent $4000 on this game and my account was hacked and stolen.
",0
"Roblox is careless and did not even care!
",3
"Plus there are inappropriate related games and the website is filled with daters!
",3
"Don't play this game!
",7
"Of course you can find a lot of bad things in these games, and people do try to get around the chat filter.
",1
"If your child ever sees anything questionable, just tell them to leave that game and play something else.
",7
"If you don't think your child is mature enough to play, you make that call.

"Sure,some people get weird and try to online date,but it's just going to be some 12-year-olds trying to find a online girlfriend.

",5
"Roblox is completely safe and those reviews of there being ""guns and violence in all of the game pages"" or ""sex games everywhere"" are COMPLETELY FAKE AND TRY TO RUIN ROBLOX!
",2
"the social media is pressuring roblox to make a lot of updates just for the safety of their child but problems for the rest.
",1
"like,curse words are filtered and barely nobody knows how to surpass the filter!
",1
"and even if they do it's just to joke around!
",7
"so don't go accusing roblox for all the problems,just blame the PLAYER that's making the problems!

"There is a lot of abusing going on Roblox,  Moderators cannot deal with it most of the time.

"The one bad thing about this game is the community.

"Lots of young kids have really ruined the game over the years since i started playing as a  young child myself.
",0
"Not to forget scammers and other stuff.
",8
"Just like any other online game, there are rude and/or toxic people that play it.
",2
"Like they censored ""well"" and ""ok"" even when you're 13+.

"I understand they could use ""beach"" as a literal beach, but nobody really does that.
",1
"Another thing, the players can be extremely rude, but most of them are nice.

"Players can be rude and bully you, but some of them can be nice, too.
",1
"Onto the violence.
",1
"Games like sword fights, make you kill other players for rewards, but I highly doubt your child is gonna kill you in cold blood and expect a reward.
",3
"It's also very hard to stumble upon one.
",8
"You can't expect a successful game like this to be without a currency, right?
",5
"You do not have to let your child play games that are violence.
",7
"However, do prevent your child from joining games like “adopt a kid” I feel that all this game are a little inappropriate as people would talk about “123 for child”, “123 for gf/bf” Roblox should also allow people to do mission to win robux instead of making people to buy it as it is known that some parents doesn’t allow, and since they are not allowed to buy robux, people that are rich tend to show off and everyt.

"Thank you sooooo much for removing THe BASIC FUNCTIoNS OF THE GAME!

"Anyway, considering there are 90 million monthly users, there must be some bad people out there.

"I have seen the online daters and though its against rules they do get punished simply by later on getting banned as note adminds and moderators will spellcheck every servers chat and see the words that bwere censored for players but not for the moderators thus they get punished.
",2
"i do see where your coming from where theres ""sex"" and ""nudity"" but note there basically lego people with no clothers yet no genitalia which means (no vaginas or penises) they can be added though creativity but they dont have realistic physics and arent 100% animated or realistic the blood and or gore is only in some games mostly military and shooters most of these games get monitored before updated and or published and its not gory alot of people ovvereact and say ""ITS AS BAD AS RAMBO THE MOVIE"" well no it
",8
"but at the 2nd year of playing roblox, strange things are popping up:
",0
"violence: not very much, a lot of people and teens can handle it, bloods are unrealistic and the only people you kill are lego men or brick men.
",4
"sexual contents: well, in my opinion, roblox WAS a completely kid friendly game, but starting from like 2016 or something, people started online dating (mostly kids but i just don't know why) on roblox and also started making really dirty games, but it's just player's fault, sexual games will get banned immediately by the roblox moderators.
",2
"consumerism: half of roblox players spends a lot of money on roblox, especially the online daters, they spend tons of real money on roblox, buy robux (the virtual currency of roblox) and use them to buy clothings, to just make them look cooler and attractive, but there are only a few pay-to-win games, like pet simulator, which fortunaly is not popular anymore.
",6
"alchohols, drugs and smoking: absolutely no alchohols, no drugs but some ""gangsters"" on roblox do smoke virtually and i've onòy seen one.
",1
"but there are still scams that steals people's information, account or/and robux (i mentioned earlier) by creating games or websites that ""promises"" people free robux.
",8
"conclusion: roblox is a great game, but it is getting a bit worse due to some dumb players, i would consider this 12+, even if i'm 10.
",2
"It allows the d word that’s a worse version of crap.
",1
"But that’s just their mind.
",7
"If they do that stuff, let them.
",7
"Just b/c they do that stuff doesn’t mean ur child will.
",7
"And if they do, ground them.

"Point is, u can’t change how a person thinks, so stop trying.
",5
"I used to play ROBLOX when I was 10 but now I don’t think ROBLOX is a good game.
",0
"I stopped playing roblox because it has so many bad stuff in that game.
",0
"It has games that you rob banks like jailbreak.
",8
"Games that can steal your account (free robux games) There are some games that you do sexual stuff.
",5
"Okay let’s say roblox has hashtag system but kids found someother words, like fudge (f word)
",4
"Roblox’s community is super bad.
",2
"I saw in some videos that says “Roblox is adding voice chat” it’s super dangerous for kids.
",1
"Very rarely theres game which have inappropriately stuff on there games, the roblox admins woupd take it fown within the first hours.
",9
"This does have a downside though because the games in-game currency , ROBUX, costs real money.
",6
"Make sure they don't fall into some scams like free ROBUX games.
",8
"If they can't code or don't want to, they can use free models or make there own.
",8
"Please be aware free models can cause viruses and getting hacked so please use trusted models like khole's admin so they can use admin in there game and ban people or hire staff.
",5
"Please note the moderation staff is small so bans and reports take a long time.
",2
"Noob means they act like a new player or are being stupid.
",1
"Please don't be offended.
",1
"With that being said, it's not a game you can just sit your kid in front of and ignore for a couple hours.
",3
"There is content that a kid of most ages womt understand, but it is inappropriate nonetheless.

"I had to walk into my 8 yo sibling on a role-play server with an alcoholic ""father"" and plenty of innapropriate themes.

"I'm 11 now , and people lure me into these games that have super fake names so that they are really hard to find again  , they have naked people , let people swear and do ""it"" ( have sex)  .

",7
"Yes I’m aware of the guardians saying that roblox is a bad game that includes inappropriate actions, profanity, and etc.
",3
"Roblox has this thing called “hashtags” if your account is underaged, anything that is inappropriate or includes swearing is tagged.
",1
"Roblox also has a thing where players call other players “noob”.
",8
"Noob isn’t a hurtful word.
",4
"Guardians also mention “use of violence”.
",4
"I understand that, but it’s not like GTA (Killing realistic humans).
",3
"Roblox “violence” games only slay LEGO blocks which isn’t classic we to human figures.
",2
"I don’t think that children should play this.
",7
"And other players are always calling names like “gold digger” “noobs” and “fags”
",1
"Sometimes there can be some bad things but roblox tries there best to prevent that.
",1
"It can have violence so make sure to check what your kid is doing from time to time.

"That do eventually get banned pretty quickly.

"I have to say that english isn't my first language and i wrote this on phone.

"This post might look fake because a 10 year old cant talk english so well and he's from an another state too.

"Violence and weapons.
",0
"There are games with guns and stuff but a small amount of them have blood.
",2
"One thing i dont like is the default death animation.
",6
"You just fall into pieces which is too brutal.
",2
"So there might be online daters in some games but these games usually aren't popural and they get deleted.
",3
"Just report them and they hopefully get banned.
",7
"There are also some condo games which are VERY BAD.
",8
"But they will get deleted like a day after they're created and also they are unpopular and it makes it hard to find them too.
",8
"Its because the moderation isnt very good.
",2
"Some people have been banned for saying ""hi"" ingame.
",6
"The chat system is a joke.
",1
"Completely innocent words will show up as hashtags and many words can be bypassed.
",1
"So for example if someone wants to say shit, they can say sheet or shet or something like that.
",2
"They need to fix the chat system.
",1
"Because accounts under 13 cant say youtube, or any social website.

"0.0001 percent of internet users are pedophiles.

"I can confirm that the filter is pretty bad (not in the way that it censors too less, it actually censors too much), but i feel news articles and parents alike are slandering ROBLOX for no apparent reason.
",2
"It also has banned anyone from saying Discord in any chat, (as Discord is a 3rd party chat app that you can call and text people on, so naturally, ROBLOX has banned it.
",4
"ROBLOX doesn't make the games, so it shouldn't be at fault for what the COMMUNITY makes.
",7
"Never the less, the bullying is a major problem because the community is rather toxic, but at the end of the day kids are edgy and that cannot be helped.
",9
"Dating is also a big problem and as a player it is very possible to give out private information.
",8
"remember Roblox is not rated, because it's a ONLINE game 3rd party apps have NOTHING to do with Roblox and you should be monitoring your kid instead of letting them do what ever they want!

"but sometimes roblox can be gross.
",1
"But don't be thinking that the Daters are pedophiles.

"the population of pedophiles is only %1.

"If I could give this game 0 stars, I would.
",5
"I witnessed players swearing, having parties where they would pretend to drink, smoke, and engage in sexual activity( which is probably the most common offense).

"The game has filters for curse words, but players get around them by making up their own terms for inappropriate language.

"There are several cases of grown adults signing up for this game and creeping on kids.
",5
"This is what made me delete the account myself and the comments I saw and received made me feel very self-conscious as a young girl.

"This was five years ago and I still feel uncomfortable about it.
",0
"If you think roblox is bad for kids you have never been on Reddit or Twitter or The Internet so what if you hear Spooky Scary Skeletons blast at full volume you call Roblox Inappropriate for kids you see your kid playing murder mystery 2 then yell at them people look at reviews and when people talk crap about games minecraft or saying roblox is a Minecraft clone can make people not play games and Roblox came before Minecraft idiots roblox might have robux that are overpriced but still it’s a good game
",7
"Well actually a bot does it.
",2
"This bot makes really unfair bans and warnings.
",2
"I got banned for a few days for a shirt of Ugandan Knuckles, a meme.
",9
"They have had a lot of doodoo scandals.
",4
"You should know that they do a lot of these mistakes so make sure your child is supervised while playing in case they get scammed.
",7
"Another thing, scam bots.
",5
"Always supervise your kids because if you spent robux in Roblox they can be scammed and the password can be changed unless you add a safety PIN code which I have with an email account.
",7
"Parents, do not blame the site for these players.
",3
"There is a 0.01 percent chance you will find an adult being inappropriate with a child in this game.
",9
"The game also has a bad filtering system.
",1
"You can’t say numbers or certain words like Kart under 13.
",1
"Violence isn’t bad there isn’t blood in normal games unless you play FPS games like Phantom Forces.
",3
"They can’t patch stuff quick enough because they have millions of users to monitor.
",8
"There is a filtering system but it has flaws.
",1
"If an account is under 13 they can’t send messages.
",5
"There are some “toxic” (rude) players but I advise ignoring game chat (that’s what I do) I suggest you play the game with your child to see for yourself if you think your child is responsible enough to make sure they are safe.
",7
"There is violence but you can avoid these games by simply not playing them.
",3
"Don’t listen to the hateful reviews here, those are personal experiences!
",4
"Don’t send hate because they game isn’t right for you!
",5
"If you see this type of abuse, just use the report tool and you'll be fine.
",7
"But roblox is kind of greedy and only wants money bbut i'm fine!
",7
"So once i found a girl acting inappropriate and i reported her.I think she was banned.So kids can play this game only if they not gonna roleplay with inappropriate people.
",0
"Just watch were you are clicking cause there is spam and inappropriate adds and stuff so just pay attention!
",7
"There are some bloody gun games (like Phantom Forces), and there are some games for 3+ (like Meep City).
",3
"These ban the adult forums.
",2
"An update that came out I year or two ago blocker all swearing in the chat.
",0
"It’s so over protective that I couldn’t ask people if they saw the hunger games movie on the holidays.
",0
"Robux do cost a lot of money, but you don't need to buy it.
",6
"Roblox actually censors a lot of things.
",1
"Honestly, if your that concerned about your child giving away their address, make their account under 13, which will not allow them to say any numbers.
",7
"However, the words you can say are gay, hell, and heck.
",1
"With an account 13 and older, you can say gay, hell, god damn, frick, heck, and lmao.
",5
"If someone is sending you inappropriate messages, unfriend them.
",5
"If someone knows where you live, call the cops.
",3
"Now, parents minds have been poisoned with the idea that it is infested with pedophiles.
",2
"However, it's not true.
",7
"You would be surprised at the amount of inappropriate little kids there are.
",7
"But roblox moderators banned players For No reason And sometimes person banned players For No reason either
",6
"I hope people don't base their opinions solely on reviews of kid games.
",4
"Reviews are just other people's opinions.
",2
"I live in one of those super strict households where my parents are extremely iffy on almost anything I want to do.
",8
"Little kids are heavy censored by roblox to the extent of not even leting them say numbers.
",1
"List of words you cant say: meet,cow,pig,fat,dumb,dude1(who is a dev) and many more.
",1
"If you read the Roblox TS (terms of service) it tells you the Rules,if someone is not following the rules you can report them,they will get warned banned or terminated but the downside is there's games that are violent and cruel and should not be played by kids,but the reason I put it 9 or older is cause there's scammers and trollers and 9+ knows what to do,if you're child is 7- don't play the game,it would be creepy and scarry and that's all I half to say!
",3
"It's not going to be 100% kid friendly, most are.
",7
"I've been looking for the parent reviews today and I've been realizing this is stupid like some of them have sexy stuff drugs and cigarette what drugs were the cigarettes in Roblox it says consumers and get that from Robux but that's just so they can keep the platform running And the swear words are just the broken chat filter being dumb so stop being crazy people and start thinking
",1
"I told her no that she is a creep.
",0
"now she harass me all the time and her friends.
",0
"roblox did not help my mom when she called them.
",0
"she does this to kids that play murder mystery 2. it is a bad game for kids.

"roblox is not safe.
",2
"I'm not allowed to play my favorite game anymore.
",0
"I’m not actually 13, I’m 12, but literally no one would read my review if it said I was.
",0
"Anyway, I’ve been playing Roblox for a long time and it definitely gotten worse over the years.
",6
"Despite this, great games have been released, but some are ruined by small children begging you for things (robux, items in games, etc.)
",2
"which is extremely annoying.
",1
"Please, PLEASE make sure your child doesn’t become one of those kids, it’s the worst.
",7
"Also, I’ve seen many angry parents complain about ‘explicit’ messages that their children have received... You literally cannot type numbers if your account is under 13.
",7
"You can’t type any of these:
",1
"“Sex”
",0
"“Where do you live?”
",7
"“How old are you?” 
",4
"“F*ck, sh*t, etc...”
",0
"“Nazi”
",0
"“R*pe”
",0
"And a lot more... 
",2
"All in all, the game is great and has a good filter system, but has a lot of annoying little kids infesting it.
",2
"There is no sexier swearing, but some games contain violence, though it is nothing brutal as the avatars are in no way lifelike.
",3
"And the moderation team is only comprised of a few people,please cut them some slack.
",2
"Also, if you are worried about scammers, you should probably sit back and think about the internet as a whole.
",7
"Can't expect everything to be safe right ?
",5
"Most of the issue with profanity, violence, and NSFW is often filter bypass.
",1
"The ""front page"" as it's known by players isn't exactly the best way to represent the game.
",1
"Those games attract significantly more creeps than other games.
",8
"""Roleplays"" should be avoided at all costs.
",3
"There are a few games, only one to be exact, on the front page with blood.
",3
"These types of games aren't an issue for anyone older than say 10 or 11 as they're still quite cartoonish, but younger children might want to stay away from them.
",4
"Explore ROBLOX; there's a whole category of groups that are often ignored.
",8
"Many discord servers are poorly filtered or not filtered at all.
",1
"I'd suggest keeping any kids younger than 13 away from discord servers because of this.
",4
"The main issue parents have on ROBLOX is the ""sex"" games though.
",3
"These games are not allowed on ROBLOX, and as such, are removed within a few days.
",6
"If your child plays one of these games, it is mainly your fault.
",7
"These games are insanely hard to find without actively looking for them.
",6
"Speak with your children about inappropriate games.
",7
"""Bullying"" is another large issue for parents, but it is honestly the smallest issue on the website.
",9
"If you still find this being an issue, consider purchasing a small amount of roblox to buy a cheap outfit.

"I'm sure you've read many other reviews by kids/parents saying that ROBLOX is inappropriate for kids.

"Some users can be really disgusting but you can always report them or leave the game and join another server.

"Just one problem, the community is sometimes really mean and toxic.

"Roblox seems like a dangerous and inappropriate game for children under 10, and it could, but that is rarely a problem.

"Roblox is against bullying, inappropriate content, violence, alcoholic or drug phrases, and other danger bringing content.
",8
"There are some games that are user/kid friendly, while others may contain violence, sex, swearing, drugs, or non safe content.

"Online Daters: usually bored kids who ask random girls out in games, most of those kids get cyberbullied and offended till they quit

"Manipulators: revelant roblox players that use fans for own gains, like raiding or cyberbullying people like online daters and developers with bad reputation.

"Trolls: people who join social/hangout places or places in general to say innapropiate things or insult players.
",2
"Unfriendly adult playerbase: toxic adults whom insult casual or young young aged players.
",5
"They're trolls that are ruining the game for you....
",3
"If your child is under 13 Roblox will blank out words that may be harmful.

"But you use Real money to buy Robux and now comes the problem.
",6
"And sometimes a Robux scam games pops up, and these kind of games trying to fool you and take all your robux.
",7
"So he can just steal all the things you have and thats a problem because Roblox is not so quick to remove those games.
",7
"And that causes many accounts are scammed (Fooled)
",6
"If your child goes on those games, that's nobody's fault but theirs (and yours for bad parenting!)
",5
"Many of the people who ask for ""sex"" are just kids behind a screen who don't have their parents home.

"Don't want to do it?

"Leave the game.
",1
"There is always the occasional immature child who constantly tries to bypass the filter and say ""fuyk you"", but there's not much you can do about it and they exist in almost every game.

",1
"I almost forgot about clans/groups!
",9
"Yes, many war clanners are toxic, it's very easy to ignore them.
",8
"In conclusion, while roblox has a few unsafe games, 99 percent of the time they are so hard to find, it is the child's fault for going on them, or they are on it voluntarily (just leave the game, not hard to do it).

"It isn't fun when you play, because there are no fun games, and you get bullied because you have no Robux!
",7
"In some games, it can also get really sexual, so I don't recommend this game for younger kids!
",4
"Roblox isn't a very ""Child-Friendly"" game it contains swearing, you can give out any of your information even with safe chat and there are a lot of child predators on that game so to parents don't let an 8 yr old play this game or any child that's under 13
",4
"So lets start with this,first of all roblox is a 10+ game so minor ages kids are not recommended to play.Second off all Roblox is a teenager game so ""violence"" and blood are normal into this types of games,Roblox is pretty good in his moderation but you should remember that theres more than a BILLION of user and no more than 100+ admins so is pretty hard to moderate,also is impossible to censure every word so its normal to see Douc**bags swearing,also robux IS FUCK*** OPTIONAL you dont need to buy your kid

"The worst thing ever, Always puts messages in chats of games of ""go to this website to get freeeee robux"" and all it does is trick young kids to give their password then they steal their account to share EVEN MORE robux scams.

"Its dumb, just like buying a car that is 30000$ thats worse then a 6500$ car, One last thing is that there is a filter, it is somewhat good, but people complain about people bypassing it, so they make it more strict, and more strict, and so on.
",8
"almost making it so you cant talk.
",6
"The chat in roblox is really strict.
",1
"Anything you say that’s inappropriate will get turned into hashtags so for example if I put the f word in the chat it will be this ####.
",1
"Listen, Roblox has its downsides, yes, but what do you expect from a game that’s mainly user based?
",3
"which is pretty unavoidable, however that doesn’t mean that the game completely sucks because of a few bad people.
",2
"And to those who complain about “needing robux to look cool” are you kidding?
",7
"Just let yourself be you and if people tell you you’re not a good person because you don’t have robux, they’re wrong, because it only matters about who you are as a person.
",7
"Also, people concerned about their account being taken, here’s my advice: Make a strong password, no, Strongpassword123 isn’t a very good password.
",1
"Don’t click fishy links or give your information to any website that isn’t the official Roblox website.
",5
"There have been people (including my friends) who have gotten hacked just from clicking the link and they send the fishy link to you pretending to be your friend, don’t go to it!
",5
"Very similar to the previous ones, but there are spam bots that post fishy links on clothing and group comments, or even in game, don’t go to those either.
",5
"There are also scam games that are usually called “Free robux!” No matter how legit they seem, please do not give your information to them.
",8
"Sorry for the long one, just had to get it off of my chest.
",0
"On the bad side, you have exploiters that have a main goal to ""troll"" kids, another bad one would be very money hungry, aswell as some of the developers.
",1
"There are plenty of problems, though.
",2
"For one, there's the large amount of scams that run rampant on the site.
",9
"Then there's the inappropriate content.
",1
"What it boils down to is a bunch of edgy teens thinking it's funny to ruin the experience for others.
",2
"Although this is an issue, it's not as bad as you might think it is.
",3
"It's quite rare to actually find these things unless you are explicitly looking for them.
",6
"One point I rarely see truly spoken of is the bullying, and while quite a few children get bullied for not spending money on the game and are so called ""bacon hairs"", the problem stems mostly from spoiled brats who can be easily ignored if you block them or don't go to their ""breeding grounds""(role-playing games like Meepcity and Roblox High School 2).
",5
"Simply put, DON'T PLAY THEM IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO VIOLENCE.
",0
"There is a chance you may see a bad word in the game from filter bypassing, If you see a no-no word, There is a report user function that allows you to report whoever said the naughty word, There is a 50/50 chance the user could get banned.
",5
"There's a chance that a user can upload a graphic or disgusting game and it'll take a while for the moderation to catch it.
",3
"The moderation system in this game is very flawed so there is a chance your kid might get terminated for no reason whatsoever.
",6
"If some graphic image lands on the website, It will eventually be deleted.
",3
"Roblox is often looked upon as inappropriate and poorly monitored.
",1
"Roblox has many security features, such as a highly strict chat filter, inability to share social media links if the player is under 13, and a pin that parents can attach to the account which must be entered to change settings.
",5
"You can also disable the chat within the settings, making it impossible for strangers to communicate with your children.
",1
"Of course, like any game, there will always be immature players who find ways around the filter.
",1
"As to violence, there are multiple games that involve attacking other players or NPCs.
",8
"The weapons are often swords, guns, or knives, which aren't terribly realistic.
",3
"However, I don't think that any type of violence, especially guns, is appropriate for younger kids, and that is why I think that Roblox should be 12+.
",4
"In terms of sexual content, some online daters manage to use seemingly innocent animations and turn them into inappropriate positions.
",1
"You can send a report to the moderators under anyone's username, however Roblox does not always read reports as much as they should.
",2
"If that's not enough, for whatever reason,  just don't let your kids play it.
",7
"While I see many views about roblox being 'unsafe' and having 'poor moderation' I would like to make you aware of some things.
",7
"Firstly inappropriate chat.
",1
"Secondly inappropriate games.
",1
"I do not deny that in my 2 years of playing roblox I have  seen some games inappropriate for younger users.
",2
"However ROBLOX is very swift at taking down these games and if you moderate your child / have their chat disabled they will most likely never find them.
",7
"Thirdly, account terminations
",4
"Very simple to those saying Roblox has unfair bans.
",9
"However there are a lot of slip ups in moderation considering 1 billion people play this game.
",2
"just try to to get scammed there and don't bully.
",5
"oh and some people call you a noob, sometimes, they're a noob themselves.
",2
"reporting hardly does anything, from my experience.
",1
"Although some games are supposed to be innocent, people can still take advantage of it and do pretty inappropriate things.
",8
"Some games can contain violence, but a very, VERY few include blood and gore.
",3
"Roblox players can chat in-game, and some people can be not the most appropriate person.
",1
"Although Roblox's censoring from swear words to hashtags is a bit broken, it's better to be safe than to hear a ton of people swearing.
",1
"If you are not comfortable with the chatting system, you can go to settings and disable chat.
",7
"From the starting of last year, roblox has been a boring place where you keep playing the same popular games.
",9
"The people who curse will always find out a way to curse in roblox.
",1
"Reporting players has never worked for me.
",6
"I also got robux with my own money last year and believe me, ROBUX IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
",0
"I have 200+ robux left and I don't know what to do with it.
",0
"My father even started thinking that roblox is hacked or something.
",5
"It makes it so certain things are filtered.
",1
"roblox recently removed a place called the ""forums"" where you could get help.
",6
"it was heavily moderated but also pretty bad.
",1
"there was alot of trolls posting things such as ""how do i breathe i swallowed a shovel"" or something along those lines.
",3
"roblox has tried its best to alienate users in my opinion.
",0
"they filter some of the dumbest things which get turned into hashtags.
",2
"they sometimes filter ""wall"" and ""well"" for no reason.
",1
"there are also alot of people who bypass roblox's system and upload innapropriate content and racist decals.
",1
"people are also uploading viruses to the game's model section, but if you dont insert them into your game you are safe.
",7
"The only problem is that people can ask for personal info, which is really rare for Roblox.
",1
"And, there are barely any games that are not child friendly, so dont think it’s 18+.

"(In my opinion...) But personally in my experiences, Roblox is a targeted bullying game for the young ones...

"I believe little kids under 11, will get offended by this... Another heave of junk is ""online dating.""

"Roblox can be safe BUT some games can be VERY inappropriate.

"this game doesnt send any good messages because its not really a educational game i am a ex-Roblox online dater and i say it can be dangerous in game like ""adopt and raise a cute baby"" and games similar to that if your kid has a computer and plays roblox on it there is alot of good games for computers for phone there is a good game called ""iron sights"" but if your not ok with your child playing violent game (remember theres no blood in most of the games) you child can play roleplaying games (but those haves

"i think so yeah they are also alot of games where you dont have to roleplay or have violence but if your kids know how to keep themselves safe or are aloud to play games with violence but if there are blood them it wouldnt leak or stay on the players body it would just be the lazy blood effect and thats it

"This game has experienced some safety issues I never or rarely ever encounter.

"There are cool games but can be violent.

"Users also swear, there is also sex and pedophiles on this game.

"I only rate it 4 starts because:

"Let's start with ROBLOX being greedy.
",9
"This is why most stuff on the website will cost you.
",6
"2nd reason: ""Inappropriate behavior/bullying"" if someone calls you a noob, this is a common insult that should 99% of the time be ignored completely.
",6
"Same thing with bullying, you can ignore people who do it or report them.
",7
"The games people say are inappropriate is random, each game is different with their own idea.

"Online dating is also a commonly mentioned thing, how ever just report them or move on.

"Trying to stop them is impossible.

"Privacy is an issue, most accounts are at risk of being hacked.

"Also, some people say that ""ROBLOX does not take a look at reports.""
",1
"No, there are way, way too many reports for ROBLOX to read all of them.
",2
"Roblox is fun except some people ruin others day and that isnt really fun.
",2
"Like ODers and exploiters.
",0
"The moderation is terrible.
",2
"Every time you report someone nothing happens to them in the next 24 hours.
",7
"ROBLOX should really update that instead of its design.
",2
"Any parents out there should install a camera on their child’s device so they know that if the child is doing anything inappropriate.
",7
"Plus ROBLOX should add refunds so if the thing you bought said it would give you something and after you rejoin it isn’t there.
",6
"Note: Even though it says too before the category title, it isn’t true for me.
",8
"First of all, there are many bullying issues online, especially on roblox.
",1
"Roblox faces many Oder-related issues.
",7
"It is also possible to purchase invisible clothing, and inappropriate clothing.
",4
"Another concern is there are many glitches within the game and it is easy to hack.

"There is an admin called :wolf (whatever someone’s name is) which takes away their clothes.
",0
"You may also use these commands to annoy people.
",3
"One way to do that is exploding them over and over again, which may cause them to lose progress.
",9
"I get kicked out of games with about 40 people in it..
",6
"I just do not like how ROBLOX is a laggy game and can cause lots of rage for children younger than me.
",4
"There is many people who bypasses the safechat filter and then uses bad words, also, I'd like to feature the online dating which thinks to be supported by THE OWN ROBLOX developers.

"Talking about violence, it is fine, it is never that strong to be like GTA.

"Don't worry: those games are impossible to be found.

"If you're willing to be bullied by some 10 year olds, or bully some 10 year olds,  this game's for you.

"I'm currently hearing a lot about adults having problems with the game, but I can assure you that this game has its ups and downs like any other game and should be treated like any online game.

"The app states that it's for 12+, so I'm confused on why parents are complaining that they're five year old children are experiencing bad things in the game.

"If you don't want your kids to play those kind of games, don't let them play it and suggest one of the millions of other games on Roblox.

"Now the negative's.
",1
"First off, I will warn parents that Roblox HQ sometimes let things slip past them or they haven't seen/got rid of players, games, or things that might be inappropriate for players.
",2
"My second complaint is the online currency that allows you to buy stuff for your avatar and access certain perks in games, called Robux.
",5
"A lot of kids dream for Robux, because most parents won't get it for them.

"Why, you ask, would they want some dumb old currency in an online fictional game?

"If you don't want to be stuck with items that other people make fun of you for, then you have to pay ROBUX.

"There is a report system, but I can assure you it doesn't work.
",2
"No matter how many times you try to report a person, they never get banned or face consequences for what they've done.
",9
"There is inappropriate content, if you search it on the front page, I mean, you need to search for the more inappropriate games that aren't deleted yet, and if you do find one, you can report it.
",7
"Secound, there are exploiters that may add  inappropriate content to a game.
",1
"Third, the robux scams, mostly younger players fall for these, the game requires you to put your username and password in the game, and later the creator of the game gains access to your account.
",5
"I belive that Roblox is appropriate for any age, but a 2-5 years old should not even look at a screen, maybe only at a TV, computers and laptops can be broken easly.

"Very good game but certain aspects of the game r not ok like chat their might be swearing or inappropriate stuff .

"The military one can be toxic.

"One thing i'm sick of is the the saying of ""Roblox is greedy for removing tix.""

"Also we have a problem of fake accounts spam joining games.
",8
"There is the extreme danger of hackers and other things like that on the internet; Roblox takes it quite seriously and they will definitely advise users of this.
",5
"Some of you must be wondering why a 16 year old is playing ROBLOX.
",6
"Like, come on!
",1
"At least play something else!

"Tycoon games attract a population of ""tweens"" (ages 8-12 is my assumption), but the level of maturity on these games are pretty low.
",3
"Role-play games and popular ""hangout"" places should be avoided at all costs.
",3
"The only players on these places are often ODers (Online daters) and scammers (They try to steal your money with ludicrous trades and deals.)
",2
"The community of ROBLOX is mildly toxic, as players are often very competitive on many games.
",5
"Mild swearing can pop up every now and then, you just have to learn to be mature and not become a sheep and follow the crowd.

"Although there are moderators on may servers, some inappropriate content can be shared.

"also there is too much swearing in roblox.
",1
"but games like meep city you see 7 year olds busting a nut in a 36 year old trap / pedophile I don’t like that the community all do weird things like online date, and be ”RoGangsters” and have thick legs it disgust me seeing that I’m quite an average player but I play only games that don’t involve any realationships.

"I got hacked like 10 times got scammed twice.

"I do not recommend this game to children under the age of 15 but it does have a huge variety of games.
",4
"And unfortunately, there are so many things wrong with this game I don't know where to begin.
",3
"Well, let's start off with the fact that you can't make your character look half-decent without spending money to buy Robux - the virtual currency of this game.
",6
"Next up, Roblox has been involved in many recent controversies - oopsies that the administrators/moderators never bothered to resolve, thus creating a rather bad reputation for themselves.
",9
"They accidentally gave random players myriads of Robux, they scammed a whole load of players who bought exclusive items during the President's Day Sale due to a glitch that allowed players to obtain the item for free, they banned famous YouTuber PewDiePie for an unknown reason (and the explanation only made things worse), they show bias towards some YouTubers and dislike others, and the list goes on and on.

"What is NOT worth your time are the interminable simulators.

"I'm not going to touch the FPS or shooter or ""violent"" games.
",7
"If you don't like shooting  and killing Lego men, don't play those games.
",3
"One last thing: I've joined a party at MeepCity ( not because I like the game, but because I wanted to check the state of the game's community) and saw atrocious obscenities being blurted out in chat by various players that think that talking about sex is a perfectly normal thing.
",5
"They were clearly violating the Roblox ToS and Rules, and so I reported most of them.
",0
"Improve your report system, Roblox!
",7
"Overall a substandard disappointment.
",1
"My only concerns about this are for the community and updates.
",6
"The community can get kind of toxic, and annoying to deal with.
",1
"Some games on roblox are lucky enough to avoid these kind of people entirely.
",2
"There is also some updates to roblox that can get kinda annoying, but not a problem for children.
",2
"It's more like an App Store than an actual game.
",6
"However, there are games that younger kids should stay away from, which contain some unrealistic violence, but might still scare some young kids.
",3
"Their moderation/filtering system isn't that great, so tell your child to close the chat window if they see bad language.
",5
"DON'T LET YOUR CHILD PLAY THIS GAME, THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE EXPOSED TO PORNOGRAPHY, NUDITY, SWEARING, DRUGS.
",0
"ALCOHOL, RACISM, AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THEY WILL BE BEGGING YOU FOR THE IN GAME CURRENCY CALLED 'ROBUX'
",0
"IT ALSO ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE OR UPLOAD THEY'RE  OWN GAMES, AUDIOS, DECALS (IMAGES), OBJECTS, ETC.
",0
"I ADVISE ALL PARENTS TO NOT LET YOU'RE TEEN OR CHILD PLAY THIS GAME.
",0
"DO NOT LET YOU'RE LITTLE ONE PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!

"They can chat with other people, if you don't like that your child is doing that, this game is not for you.

"Report Abuse - Have a Problem with a Player?
",1
"Just go to the Report Abuse tab, select their username, and select what they did wrong, then write a sentence on what happened, people say they don't read reports, they're wrong.
",2
"But, don't stalk someone to make sure they're punished.
",7
"It has a lot of people cursing, you get falsely banned, There is a game called ""Jailbreak"" it has lots of blood and guns.
",3
"Do not play this game.
",7
"You stupid people 1-star raters.
",8
"But sometimes, things simply get OUT OF HAND.
",9
"Obviously, there will be some child predators looking for ways to collect innocent children, and that is why you'd have to moderate who your child is talking to.
",3
"The reason that you simply have to moderate (and I mean check up like once or twice a month, not like stalking them) is that the odds of a predator being behind an account is very slim (1 in 1,000).
",7
"Another problem is that the moderation is very poor.
",2
"Many people are starting to assume that the moderators are bots.
",2
"Disgusting, I know.

"I believe that it was removed and/or the player behind it was banned.
",0
"I can go on about some more bad things, but this is turning into an essay to I'll get started with the good things.
",3
"The chances of someone writing ""no-no words"" into the chat are low, since it isn't too easy to bypass the chat filter.
",1
"The bad thing is, people have discovered ways to bypass it with numbers.
",1
"That means that it is possible for a predator (this is a very uncommon thing to happen) to get a phone number, or even an address out of a child by telling them how to bypass the filter.
",9
"Anyways, I'll say one more bad thing before ending this.
",9
"ROBLOX is great, but it's just full of BS.
",2
"One of the things that I really dislike though is how ROBLOX gets greedy.
",2
"The website constantly advertises buying ""Robux"", which is a fake currency that you can buy with real money.
",8
"The thing is, these groups are too strict.
",8
"Most of the time, they require perfect grammar from CHILDREN to seem ""professional"" which annoys me.
",6
"Good thing ROBLOX has a safe chat if you say a bad word it will show up like this ""####"" and if your 5 and under, Dont JOIN Phantom Forces it's like a shooting game with blood and there are online daters ""ODer for short"" and people are jerks then they make free robux games.
",3
"and some people dont do safe chat like they do the nice messages but rich people call people that just joined ""noobs"" and if you want a friend friend me damenangrybird
",4
"Don’t trust people who want to date sure they might look pretty in ROBLOX but it’s a lego game.
",7
"They might be Hideous in real life.
",8
"So never play more safer games that’s not meep city or adopt me
",8
"Other than the overpriced Robux.

"Everything in the Catalog is very expensive, and a dollar = 80 Robux.

"Hi, I'm a veteran on Roblox, I played this game several years ago, and it's now getting really boring.

"Smart, but small and bad moderation

",0
"Lazy games.
",0
"As a 15 year old, I have a friend that has became toxic, lazy, and downright heading the wrong direction in life, because of the negative influence from Roblox.
",8
"There used to be Forums, but they became so polluted with toxic posts and arguments that the game has to take it down.
",1
"For me, Roblox was a disappointing experience.
",8
"It also proves that kids and the internet does not mix well together.
",6
"And as for my friend,(Not going to mention his name) He is a lost cause.
",0
"There is swearing but who cares.
",1
"Roblox is not working child-friendly!
",8
"Let's make it SO pornographic, and to look nice, the children have to pay!''
",4
"So apparently, they LIKED that idea and turned a NICE community into a community of perverted 20-ish year olds.
",0
"Now, having been stuck with Pornblox for 3/2 years right now, the games have become downright BORING AND SEXUAL!
",1
"This stupid game even removed tix!

"I have had 3 accounts hacked.

"gamemodes where they literally ask you for your password to hack you.

"To sum up, don't play this game, kids.

"Terrible.
",0
"in roblox noob means beginner or for some who it means you havent got robux and there just calling your childs characters name NOT your child.
",9
"I mean, its alright.Though when hackers and trollers come in it ruins it completely.Its a family friendly website for kids but in the same time just god awful.Thank you for reading this.
",4
"So You know a lot of adults always say ""Oh, it has a lot of violence"" or ""People can just swear"" but i am here to cover the wrong things up.
",2
"From now on (until it's turned off by someone) your kid cannot play any games with high level of violence like murder mystery, jailbreak, etc.
",3
"If you decide to give your kid a ROBLOX Gift card, i do not recommend that, as people on roblox randomly types in random code and can get your Gift Card as invalid.
",3
"And don’t worry about people calling you noobs.
",7
"It has nothing to do with swearing.
",6
"You should NEVER go on supposedly “Free robux” sites.
",5
"They NEVER work.

"They ask for your password to get to your account and steal it!
",5
"They are just bots playing the game for people to join it!

"Again, thats just a scam!

"But enough of the “Free robux” games.

"I've seen swearing people or whatever back then, But  roblox has gone a bit too far with the filter people easily bypass it but roblox patches exploits and bypasses every Wednesday back in 2018 - 2017

"In all due respect It seems like almost all privacy concerns are the Kids faults, You would have to put great effort into getting in trouble.
",6
"The moderation is taken out of context and here is why, if you use the site and you are over 12 (select 13+ during account creation) then you can see numbers and more language.
",5
"The moderation seems to get a bad rap for being sloppy, to this I say that it is very sloppy and very hard to get through, It tags way more than it should to an annoying degree.
",8
"I noticed a few years ago when my account was changed to over 13 that the system allowed more questionable language that is closer to swearing like ""aw h#ll"" but not really swear words.
",4
"A stupid idiot teenager could get themselves in trouble but you would have to try and at that point its all the users fault.
",7
"Frankly the complaints seem to come from parents saying that kids get addicted and thats not the games fault.
",2
"Your kids are your problem.
",7
"People who say people on roblox are pedophiles are only accounting for 1/100000 (at most) of the people playing, and pretending the other 99999/100000 don't exist.

"In a few games there are people who will roleplay inappropriate things.
",1
"So roblox a kid friendly game, but some stuff happen.
",2
"(this review sucks)
",7
"Although some games are inapropriate, they are really hard to find nowadays, since the moderators are actually putting in an effort to vanquis these games.
",6
"I've gotten to know the community, and it's pretty toxic.
",6
"I must say, people think the community is bad but they really only see the bad side of it.
",2
"When people search up ROBLOX, they find all these bad reviews from people that haven't played it much.
",2
"And all they find from the reviews is the people meeting trollers, which I've dealt with a lot.
",9
"I will admit ROBLOX has problems, like scammers and password guessers, which is why you should make a complex password or the name of something with a couple numbers.
",5
"They simply don't have enough admins to cover millions of active users each day, and by giving them a bad name you simply make it worse for a good game to have good people play it.
",2
"By people saying ROBLOX has a bad moderation system, they don't realize that they attract more people that do bad things.
",8
"And the people that have their children exploited, (Exploiting is something that isn't hacking, but is something that the game already has, like if someone without admin is exploiting they are probably running through walls ( nocipping ) which people need to realize before making comments.)
",6
"ROBLOX overall is interpreted the wrong way and I myself have always loved roblox.
",1
"Nothing bad has really happened on roblox besides your average exploiters.
",6
"And your kid may be cyber bullied because he may have no robux, but he should remember nobody is really rich on roblox even if they say they are.
",7
"People can be mean but tell your kid that don't care what they say, they're just kids like them.
",7
"Roblox may also have predators, which people talk about all the time.
",1
"but in reality in all my years I've never met what these people call ""Child Predators"".
",0
"People will troll, trying to get your kid off the website by trying weird stuff, but you need to remind your kid to write down their username, if they can take a screenshot, do it.
",7
"You can report them, people will say it doesn't work.
",1
"but if you send proof via email to the roblox support team you can probably get someone banned.

"And if your kid can't do anything about it, tell them to just leave the game and block them.

"By blocking them they can never join your game.

"First, the games are community built, so there are some downsides to look at:
",2
"
",0
"Games that include Phantom Forces, Those Who Remain, and many others include FPS experiences that include violence and gore.
",3
"For parents, it's epecially harder to keep track whether or not younger children are playing these types of games.
",4
"The only way you can prevent this from happening is just keeping an eye out.
",5
"Games such as Meepcity are sometimes covered in online daters that can cause inappropriate content for anybody, young or old.
",1
"Sights of people having a 'Party' in Meepcity, showing inappropriate content which I prefer not to say were spotted, and now sort-of fixed by the developer of this game in ROBLOX.
",9
"And because this is community based there are games that include extremely inappropriate content.
",3
"This keeps swear words and inappropriate content to be put into the chat system.
",1
"Say that somebody says, ""F*** you!""
",0
"or something along those lines, but lets stick to F you.

"Punishment:

"This is known as Reporting, which kids on ROBLOX should learn to use in a bad situation.

"Money:

"
",0
"For me, this is one of the most important downsides to me.
",2
"(TIX, the free earnable currency that is worth less, has been removed.)
",6
"Many people show off their hats and cloths and the big con is that some kids will feel like they aren't accepted and they need hats and cool clothing to be noticed which is a sad thing about the community.
",3
"These can even go as far as a child being called a noob, or newbie, for being in a default avatar state.
",5
"Some problems:
",0
"Bypassing the Filter:
",1
"Some users use Roblox for the wrong thing.
",1
"Online Dating is a thing on Roblox which is NOT allowed in any form.
",1
"CONS: You sometimes will get games where it's bad and there's blood and horribleness but just try your best to watch over your child and make sure you know what there doing.
",7
"You just wanna make sure they put it so there year of birth is correct so Roblox can stop the nasty people in the game.
",7
"Some swearing can get through the censors, but not much.
",1
"One thing I don't like about it is that if you want to make your avatar look decent you need to buy Robux with real money, they kinda push it on you a lot.
",7
"There might be some inappropriate stuff but there is not a lot of that stuff.

"It is super good but bad

"The community can be bad being mean and doing bad stuff and that leads into number

"There is a filter it hashtags out bad words.
",1
"It also hashtags some innocent words.
",1
"If you don't have Robux you can get other clothes but, people could be mean and not accept you in there groups.
",7
"Do not fall for robux scams they may say they will give you robux but you have to go on the website (It most likely will look like roblox sign in but DON'T SIGN IN) If you sign in and put your username and password they will see what you put and  will log in YOUR account and take your Robux (If you have some) and your account and change your password and make your account scam others (I read about it online and on YouTube videos)

"Also if someone says they are going to hack you!

"Screenshot their name (maybe there profile picture) and save it that way you can report them and maybe they might get banned (Ik earlier I said report doesn't work but, it might.

"I think you can appeal to Roblox if you get banned for no reason.
",5
"Now it is really hard to get a name in Roblox because names are taken.
",1
"Also Roblox is starting to get rid of some names because they are inappropriate.
",2
"But the thing is that there's alot of parents complaining about these type of games, and if you're a parent who has a child that play Roblox, then you may know that there may be some annoying and rude people you can meet.
",7
"There is also a function in the settings bar where you can enable a more secure way for your children, it makes games with ""violence"" and such go disabled.

"I can't gurantee this stops your child from seeing rude people but it at least takes care of the more grown-up type of games.

"Other wise anything your child sees, cannot be put blame on Roblox.

"Roblox uses a censoring but it's kind of eh.
",1
"Some games are also sexual or have mild violence.

"THEY UPDATED IT TO WHERE THE COMMANDS, music, gear, and fling have been removed so I would like to say stop, only three commands got moved to admin but they took out the good ones, just stop roblox.

"Violence isn't that bad, in some games they have gore but their usually uncommon, sex & swearing are the main problems, sex in this ""kids game"" they have A LOT of emotes that allow players to go into sexual positions, in some rare cases (this happend to me a few times) you will be hit to the ground and abused, I love roblox  it is very fun but I don't think it is a good idea to let your children play this.

"Either they did it so that they could make money of innocent kids, which isn't true.
",6
"So basically, people could bot free money almost out of Roblox and if that kept up, they wouldn't be able to run the site like they still can today.
",5
"They have mods/helpers who don't do the best job, but they do eventually get taken down.
",6
"They try and try, but they eventually have to find their way down to the chest to figure out themselves because the filter is bad.
",4
"They did fix this, but why do you have to say grade before EVERY number?
",6
"One bad thing about it and a HUGE problem that comes with it.
",1
"There are people on certain games who will bully you or your child for not having enough ""Robux"".
",7
"People bully you because you didn't spend enough real-life money on something in-game.
",7
"This makes bullying a huge problem the the moderators sadly never fix.
",1
"The last thing I would like to talk about are scammers.
",4
"They are people who use games to trick little kids into putting their password in a little box.
",8
"So it's a bad thing, but they rarely ever pop up and you or your kid should be able to easily spot them and report the game.
",7
"These games usually get taken down in an average of 5-15 minutes and don't show back up.
",2
"Also, on the topic of games, there are also murder, mining, shooting, building, minigames, and everything in between.
",8
"One last, last thing, the forums, they got deleted earlier last year and it feels that they bootlegged the forums like they did with Club Penguin.
",0
"Like, it was dumb because they made like a time limit so you had to be on Roblox for I don't know how long, until it got deleted.
",0
"Almost all games are user generated, and the safe chat filter may get you complaining about how you can't say phone, but its strict for a reason.
",1
"While there will be scams asking for your password to get Robux, and innapropriate or violent games, you can always tell your kids to not play those.
",7
"Also after three years of playing you can kinda lose interest in it (unless your a youtube apperntly also I know I'm bad at spelling)also also you should watch out for hackers and stuff trying to steal your stuff and don't click on games saying free robux also don't share personal  info and passwords

"They have a filter so any bad words or inappropriate words are censored with hashtags.

"It is not bloody although it has weapons.

"If someone broke the rules, you can report them or tell an admin.
",5
"There are bots who say they give you free game money (Robux, R.I.P tix) but they actually steal your account so that's a warning.
",5
"The reason why people are saying this is bad because some games are infact, 12+.
",2
"there is something wrong with HIM, not the game.

"I can also make a list of games that are bad for 8 year olds.

"A bad problem on Roblox is how they are trying to earn LOTS of profit using a currency called robux, which for 400 is $4.95!

"There is a chat filter so that you can't swear or say anything bad.

"You can get some violent games like phantom forces or CB:RO, they have a bit of blood in them but you don't have to play them.
",3
"Also the second currency was removed (Tix) because not enough people were buying the main currency (Robux), which caused the website to get close to having to shut down.

"The game does include violence and violent weapons such as guns, rpgs, and bows.

"But there is no actual gore like blood.

"The only gore you end up seeing is the decals and blocky 'blood' in games like Apocalypse Rising and Phantom Forces.

"If you think your child is mature enough to handle this game, let them go.

"It is a genuinely good game, but there are ""exploiters"" who ruin the experience of other people online, as well as ""bypasses"" for swears, and even automated robots that will attempt to befriend your child, and send them to a link, claiming that they can receive the in-game currency for free, and the site will take their account.
",5
"I would have to say that the moderation on Roblox could use a bit more staff, as reporting content like those mentioned above will probably not get reprimanded / punished.
",2
"And there’s a lot of people getting cyberbullied because they are what called ‘noobs’.
",4
"And It’s normal if the report button doesn’t work!

"Robux cost too much... :( well on to the good parts!
",6
"well, I don’t know what to say cus I don’t really play ROBLOX anymore so eh bye!
",7
"For all parents saying the game is bad, you see, it not the game that is bad, it it's the players that are toxic/ignorant Due to the fact the most players who join are 9.
",2
"And the games are okay, only on rare occasions creepy people upload sex games to roblox which allows no chat filter and like them user sex animations like positions a child should never know.
",1
"But thanks to ROBLOX moderation within 2 hours the game is deleted.
",6
"Also, there are these people known as ""exploiters""  I used to exploit, not anymore though, anyways, they use a 3rd party software called ""exploits"" to get exploits you have to go and download them off the internet, some are VIRUSES, some are NOT.

"Even though Roblox is a great game, does not mean it is flawless.

"Now,  like all online type games, there is one thing that no online interactive  game creator can put an end to.
",9
"Yes, their are hackers, scammers, exploiters, etc, but you will always find that in interactive online games.
",9
"One way to further prevent your children ( guessing you are a parent looking for reviews )is to turn on safe chat mode, which is to stop your child to see numbers, and let anyone see numbers they type and even naughty words.
",5
"Also,if you do not want your kids to be involved with bullying, a scam, a perv.
",7
"Roblox does its best to rid of these awful things, but nothing is flawless, and if you believe Roblox caused your kid to leak private information, or get scammed etc, that is not Roblox's fault.
",5
"Yes, there are some online daters and people who swear, but there is a report option in the game menu so you can tell a moderator what a player did wrong.

"Roblox is a very fun game, but I think it has quite a lot of flaws.
",2
"Roblox is a really fun game, but the community is bad (and uhh yeah) For example, some people say ""Go commit not alive,"" or, ""Noob.""
",1
"There are these scams on Roblox where certian games promise you free Robux if you tell them your password and sometimes people ( usually younger kids and newer players) fall for it, and there are also spam/scam bots that spam stuff like ""Want some free Robux?!
",5
"',"" but at least Roblox tells people about not falling for those tricks on their blog.
",4
"There is currency in Roblox called 'Robux,' and that stuff is pretty expensive (at least in my opinion.)
",6
"There are also sometimes 'sex games' on Roblox that (weird) people make and those games get to the front page pretty fast, but at least Roblox (eventually) takes them(the games (and their creators)) down by banning the creator of the game (this means that no one can play the 'sex game' anymore).
",3
"In conclusion, Roblox is a very fun game but it has some(quite a lot of) flaws.
",2
"The ROBLOX website monitors games for anything inappropriate, explicit or just too mature.
",4
"ROBLOX also has a few downsides to it, though.
",2
"The first downside is that players in the game can online date, bypassing the filter.
",1
"And about the filter, the filter simply censors inappropriate words/swear words, by turning them in to hashtags.
",1
"(#) So, if I were to swear or say anything inappropriate like 'ass', it would simply be censored to (###).
",1
"This is because there are a few games that ask for your password, and will get you either banned or hacked on ROBLOX.
",5
"Beware as even the the moderators are doing their jobs, scams are going around saying for the pleasure of "" free "" robux ( the in game currency which is payed for with real money. )

"teach your child not to go to the links mentioned before hand to avoid an infected computer or worse.
",5
"It all around is ment to be light hearted and fun, but like the undertale fandom, people can be toxic.

"They have a filter to keep children safe and it does that by tagging the innapropriate language like this: ######.

"While some games include weapons and violence, not all have them.

"There are emotes in those games that people use to pretend they're having sex, and its ruined my innocent brain.

"In certain games (for example Roblox Rap Battles) where people can be rude, if a child is playing it it may upset them.

"Some players rage and although roblox censors swearing people sometimes find a way to drop an f bomb.

"There are bots which say to go on a website and Roblox IS doing their best to stop them and the websites are hacking webs.

"I played it,and....some people are nice,but there are many things that need to be fixed,like,if I'm not 13+ I can't write numbers in the chat,or speak other languages,like Romania,Russia and other languages are being censored.Plus,there are many online daters,scammers and bots.Reporting a player doesn't work,the report is sent,checked by an robot,and nothing happens.

"And there are also some scams that ask for your password and username but don’t believe them unless you wanna be hacked.

"People keep saying people swearing on roblox, but I don’t see that.

"There are tons of hackers out there.

"Please do not believe the free robux offers, as they are fake.

"Lately there are bots who will advertise websites that can give you viruses and take your account but the best thing to do is ignore them.
",8
"There is some name calling but if you just ignore that person they will for sure give up and stop.

"Also, parents should monitor their kids on this game, just because of online dating and shooting games.

",2
"My one complaint about Roblox is that robux is too expensive.
",4
"But now the negatives.
",0
"Roblox has been having  problem with online dating for a long time now.
",6
"Another negative is that on the decals page, there has been several botted decals that can send a virus to your computer.
",5
"If you see your child purchasing these decals, stop them IMMEDIATELY.
",7
"Plus, the game has many pedophiles.
",1
"There also has been a harsh problem with users swearing, even if there is a chat filter.
",1
"This makes parents and kids hate it.
",2
"When you make an account you get this ugly character, you can play games like Zombie Rush, a game where you and a bunch of other players are dropped into a map and you can use your weapons to go up against infinite waves of zombies!
",3
"Which costs a lot of money!
",6
"So make sure your child doesn't buy a bunch of robux!
",7
"This is a more negative review which explains more of all the bad sides of the game so you can advise your children on this.
",1
"Roblox has a strict filter which even blocks numbers so people can't use numbers to bypass it.
",1
"Sadly, due to people abusing the filter, it is starting to get stricter and silly.
",1
"There is the few odd people who will get around the filter but these people are mainly trolls and should not be taken seriously.

"Also, one last thing, Scam Bots are a major issue that is sadly unsolvable by Roblox as they always find ways of getting round filters and CAPTCHAs no matter how much time or effort Roblox put into trying to block them.

"So stop blaming the game!

"Oh and, by the way, usually when you swear in the chat, the game won't allow you to show it, it will replace the words with ####.

"It is understandable since a company has to make money, but this also leads to kids wanting robux and some parents not wanting to buy, leading kids wanting some sort of free robux, which then lead to many scams, third-party websites promising your kid free robux, then asking them to do a survey  so they make money and then stealing your kid's account and using it to promote these scams to other kids.
",5
"Roblox does take action with these websites but until they do some people already fell for it.

"Again, ROBLOX shows signs of programming quality lacks, letting exploiters easily bypass their weak firewall.

"That's the point where ROBLOX reacts to try keeping the last bit of their reputation up, after thousands of exploiters, scammers, trollers, spammers, hackers have been making their way over the young,helpless and especially immature targets, ranging from kids bullying kids, to a real life landing into hospital because of an epileptical attack after seeing some quick color changing pictures of their favorite cartoons.

"Instead, they terminated [deleted the accounts forever unless requested back, which is still a horrible process] all three of the accounts, including MINE.

"I have been playing roblox for over 3 years now and from what i've experienced, this game has been getting way worse over the years.
",6
"The problems started when new  (way to young) players started flooding in and roblox had to make their game more ""user friendly"".
",0
"This resulted in the removal of tix (roblox' only free currency) thus forcing players into BUYING ""robux"", the removal of ""guests""(untraceable, temporary accounts) and the implementation of a new, super-strict chat filter (which censors swearwords, but also the number 6, the word ""quack"" and much, MUCH more.)
",1
"And, as with all things in this world, people started making money of of the platform behind roblox' back.
",2
"Before we knew it, the site was (and is) flooded with ""spambots"" who want to trick little kids into sharing their personal information.
",9
"Don't let your kids near this monster before the age of ten, i'm still happy MY parents didn't.
",7
"Several games on Roblox include topics not appropriate for the targeted age range.
",3
"The cyberbullying and online dating are out of control.
",8
"The staff team doesn't bother to apprehend rule-breakers.
",4
"The game encourages you to waste money on ""Robux,"" which could be obtained for free until 2016.
",0
"Many players swear, perform violent and sexual acts.
",1
"The filters on the chat system are incredibly weak and allow words like ""hell"" and ""ass.""
",1
"The administrative team doesn't pay attention to the problems that occur on the game.
",3
"I attempted to protect my sister from bullies and got called a ""buttlicker.""
",0
"Reports aren't even read and online dates aren't banned because they buy the aforementioned Robux.
",7
"Very dissatisfied and disappointed to see how this game can live under its sickening staff team.
",4
"I played about three or for games, and I didn't see to much violence or swearing, but serious racism and cursing forced me to quit.
",2
"Other reviews talk about mysterious people coming to there houses, drugs and smoking, and some other pretty sick stuff.
",1
"I will never play it again.
",5
"Some games only had the occasional creep come along, or maybe a fight about something stupid every once in a while, but now there's a whole new leaf to this.
",7
"(In my opinion, stop there playing now before they see or do something they can't unsee or do.)
",2
"Although Roblox is very well made and developed, it has some downsides; it is very easy for other people to tell people to die, or harm themselves, and other inappropriate and upsetting things.
",1
"The games aren't moderated extremely well, so it is rather easy for kids to do things that aren't very suitable for an online kids game, such as inappropriate actions to make people look like they're doing stuff together.
",4
"Though other times, you can make death threats and manage to swear.
",7
"There may be mean trollers and bad/mean people (Or people who will swear, but it might get hashtagged) but you don't encounter them very often if you don't play cafe or roleplay games.

"This game DOES NOT need money to play.
",6
"There is a chat in this game but Roblox blurs out any bad words.
",3
"Kids Don't Interact with each other just , sad.
",8
"If you happen to be under 13 then they will filter the chat so that you aren't able to read bad things.
",7
"People can say some mean things about you because you don't have robux.
",7
"They might call you a ""noob"".
",4
"When you die or restart your character you body falls apart into pieces.
",3
"Roblox is a game made for kids.
",0
"Often times, they will do much worse things.
",6
"Second: Don't join in name calling wars.
",9
"Due to Roblox's hit/miss modertation, many rude people are on Roblox.
",1
"They will call people ""L"" or ""Noob"" or start going ""haha"" at an innapropriate time.
",3
"Make sure that your child knows that calling them a name as a comeback will not help anyone, including themselfs.
",7
"Most kids won't have the talent to make a game people will spend robux on, so the only other way is to buy robux, or builders club.
",6
"I was a big fan of roblox when I was young, and the community turn into a big mess that I quit it for sure.
",0
"The reason kids need to be supervised, because this place has violent, sexual content.
",6
"From the exploits and hacks that have been seen, your kid can instantly see anything that THEY'RE NOT able to see.
",7
"Kids get scammed, everywhere you see a scam.
",3
"They're allowing it, to make money a waste.
",7
"In terms of sexual content - Yes, there is a moderation system in place, but sometimes it backfires, by filtering out things that are okay for your kid to see, but not filtering out things that may raise concern.
",1
"Some players also engage in online relationships with each other, though it is widely discouraged by the community and such players are often shamed in game or reported to authorities.
",4
"Sexual content or actions do not exist in every game, and you can simply tell your kid not to play certain games or disable their chat so they cannot communicate with others.
",7
"Violence - Violence cannot technically be avoided, as many players can purchase weapons that can be used in-game and people can create and play violent games.
",3
"Violence in Roblox is typically viewed as comical, and many people welcome violence into their games, but their are select few games that do not include it.
",2
"Those reviews are 5 -7 years old, that was when Roblox was first BEING developed it wasn’t fully complete.
",0
"Scammers are the people who are trying to say hey come here kid, ya want some FREE Robux?
",6
"Well there is no way to get FREE Robux.
",1
"Your kids probably got suckered into something, so that’s on THEM.
",6
"The cussing and bullying problems are fixed due to profanity FILTERS and you can REPORT or FLAG people.
",1
"Daters and sexual people are the people playing DATING games on there, so they CHOSE to play that game.

"Okay sorry about that part.
",3
"Hope you haters learned something NEW TODAY.

"ROBLOX, is a very fun game for children, but I give it a 1, because the site is full of stuff that, has sexual violence held in it, I saw a game on the front page of ROBLOX in 2009 when my brother was playing it was called 'Meet the Gangs' I was very SHOCKED!
",0
"Now, I put Too much consumerism on the list because, we have so many people asking for the currency 'Robux' they are asking for game money so, maybe they can look cool in games and say 'I'M SO RICH!!

"I put too much Drinking/Drugs/Smoking.

"Sexual Violence.

"So, one day I was browsing Google Images, and I saw something 'sexy' a person having sex with another person in the game 'ROBLOX High School' it was revolting.

"This game is not appropriate for younger kids.I don’t think its good for any ages after all.It contains bad language,sexual actions ,violence,and more.I just listed the main problems.Please do not play this game and parents,check if your kids are playing.People on there ask personal information like where you live,your age,and name.Theres also something called” robux”People get cyber bullied if they don’t have robux so make sure that your kids aren’t playing and make sure they aren’t buying robux.Yes it cos

"But, I think Roblox has one of the WORST communities in gaming history.

"There is only a few games dont let ur kids play its  called sux people make games like that for a mild view for sex.

":)
",0
"I joined on 8/13/10, and this game has gone downhill.
",0
"First of all, reporting is pretty much useless.
",2
"The moderators are complete shit.
",1
"I saw an account made in 2015, named something inappropriate, and it's still not terminated today, 9/16/18.
",0
"The community is complete shit too.
",2
"There's tons of robux rich pre-pubescent 12 year old douchebags who like to ""roast"" people with their shit insults who don't use their mom's credit card to buy robux.
",6
"Some of the games on the front page are pretty good and creative, but there's rarely any new games added to the front page because people are playing the same boring games everyday.
",3
"Also, make sure to teach your child a lot about internet safety, and scammers, because there's TONS of scammers on this website saying ""Do you want free robux?
",7
"(and there's other ways of scamming too.)
",1
"There is no way to get free robux unless you hack the roblox website, which is illegal.
",6
"There are tons of people who waste their money on ""exploits,"" which are basically hacks in-game.
",6
"Did you see that story of a 7-year-old girl's avatar getting sexually assaulted?
",5
"Yes, with exploits you can sexually assault an avatar, but you need a script.
",5
"It's disgusting to see because the body parts were made to go with the script.
",3
"Roblox is a piece of shit game.
",2
"It's not even free.
",4
"Overall, horrible website/game.
",0
"First off, I think parents reviewing Roblox are completely exaggerating minor flaws in Roblox.
",2
"A one-time incident shouldn't give you the impression that the whole Roblox community is like one ODer or hacker because it's not.
",9
"I don't disagree with the fact that there are MANY Online Daters, hackers, robux scammers, and more.
",6
"Removing the app or blocking the website isn't going to change anything but your child or yourself will feel bad about all the memories you made during your Roblox experience.
",7
"If you see someone looking to harm you, just walk away or leave the game.
",7
"User-created content is fine unless it contains inappropriate content.
",1
"People think just because a Roblox game has ""guns"" or ""blood"" or ""death"" it must be terrible.
",2
"Literally, if you look at the material of a gun it's plastic, blood is just red circles (most games don't even have blood) and death isn't even death, it's called ""Reset Character"", which just spreads out your body parts.
",3
"ok so basically roblox is a mixed bag there are some good games there are some bad ones.
",2
"if you're not prepared to spend at least 2 euros on robux expect to be called a noob almost every time you join a game also i recommend not letting really young children play this because, there are thousands of people trying to get your password so they can give you ""free robux"" so really gullible kids get hacked almost instantly.
",6
"Also a lot of the stuff that need robux are either expensive or not worth it.
",6
"I have recently begun to lose interest in the overall community, as the general amount of players seems to be going down steadily, and as such, I have simply been doing light trading and investing using online currency.
",8
"Immediately, I contacted ROBLOX support to at least get the difference paid back to me (they charge a 30% tax on all sales), due to their error.
",6
"A support member by the name of Grace seemed to think my account was compromised, and without addressing the issue I had inquired about, provided steps to account security (all of which I already had in place with my account).
",9
"Grace then responded with an extremely similar email regarding account security and asking me to confirm ownership, which I did, however, she showed a blatant disregard to my second email.
",6
"I responded yet again to clarify my issue, becoming increasingly frustrated with the scripted messages I continued to receive.
",9
"As a response, a Support Member by the name of Allen made it again seem that I was at fault and provided a link for a post ""How To Get ROBUX.""
",5
"Allen then responded ROBLOX was unable to solve my issue, and I replied angrily requesting my ticket be re-opened.
",0
"Then came the real upsetting news:  Allen informed me I had allegedly never purchased the item in question, to which I promptly responded with necessary evidence.
",4
"I again responded, quite angrily, clarifying my issue was not account security and was rather a ROBLOX Glitch.
",0
"Chester again blatantly ignored my previous emails, and claimed I had made some kind of third party deal with the player, of which I have no affiliation with, who purchased the item.
",0
"After a lengthy response, Chester informed me ROBLOX would be unable to assist me further.
",4
"The situation has caused me to feel as though I have lost the money I have spent on this game, and that the staff honestly doesn't care about the players.
",6
"0/10 would recommend the platform, as it simply can't cater to the needs of players.
",1
"But , in fact , the game is horrible.
",4
"Roblox moderation system is broken aleardy lot of years , they are banning people with no reason , roblox is full of hackers , cyber bullies , pedophiles , spammers, bots (alot  of bots) 
",2
"and more , seems that roblox moderation does not even care about that.
",2
"But of course , there are alot of games that are the worst.
",8
"Pornographic pictures everywhere , online daters , pedophiles , violence .
",2
"Some of the players there can be harsh and disrespectful and others are friendly  which is expected.
",8
"There is this system in the chat where they censor out words, that can be difficult to communicate with other users.
",1
"However, the community is not well regulated.
",1
"It's great, but, there's plenty of exploiters and inappropriate scripts people use on the exploits and many rude people.
",1
"Those rude people make fun of others, bully others, and stuff mean people would do.
",2
"It's community has way too many of them.
",1
"Oh yeah by the way the filter is horrible and is easy to bypass so for real, this is my complete review of Roblox.
",1
"Because of this, the community is very unsafe.
",2
"There is a lot of online dating, a teensy bit of violence and there are child predators (and of course bullies).
",8
"It's not that the moderating system doesn't work.
",2
"It's that not enough people are being reported and too many people are going against the community guidelines.
",2
"Some games even sexualize the experience which is strictly against the rules.
",9
"Usually they get banned but not soon enough.
",6
"IT IS IN DANGER.
",0
"Seriously, stop overreacting!
",7
"Roblox has disappointed me.
",0
"The chat is virtually unfiltered (so people can swear or say unkind things about other players) and most games involve some sort of violence and have no educational value.
",8
"Yeah, i think its good but not the hackers who hacks the game to make people look like shrek and people who make FREE ROBUX GAME *LEGIT* 
",1
"This is game is better if you look at the good games such as Work At A Pizza Place, Mad Murder, Obby's (SOME), Prison Life, Top Model and the list can go on but the community is just dont talk about it.
",1
"When I first started on roblox with no robux I was called an noob and poor.

"But then... there were users who shared a huge distaste for it.

"I was called a “thot”, a “white as b”, “rich brat” and whatever disgusting slang they used that you could name.

"One user accused me of stealing my mother’s credit card.

"Not to mention the countless amount of racism I’ve encountered on the website and in-game.

"Got called a cracker cause my character was white.

"Got called the n word after making my character black.

"There is too much for the moderators to handle and in game reporting never freakin works.

"Sitting on a computer for hours can make your body weaker meaning that physical activity will become harder/you will feel like running a mile which used to be easy is now hard.

"If your kid is around my age which is 16 I would recommend telling them about how hard it is to have a career in roblox and why making roblox a job is not worth it.
",6
"Creating games and stuff takes time and effort just as much as a job but it is hard to make a good career out of it.
",6
"hey i don't really have a problem with this game but I just want to say that this game is full of pedophiles and other creeps, I know this because i met my big tiddy goth gf there and when we finally met in person I discovered that she was really a he and was actually 52 instead of 16 like she had told me.

"we don't have any lights down here and the internet is extremely slow but it doesn't stop us from torturing each other and trying to rip each others eyes out but thats another story.
",0
"Now in 2018, this game has become unplayable and not enjoyable.
",7
"But instead of trying to make games and express creativity, this game has become a social media site with excessive amounts of toxicity.
",2
"Over the years, Roblox has tried to fix their issues with implementing updates that did nothing but drive away the veteran players such as myself.
",1
"For example, they implemented a chat filtering system to cut back on the amount of swearing which is good, but the filtering system got so bad that I can't even say numbers or specific words that have nothing to do with a bad context.
",1
"But even before the filter, the admin team would kick and enforce rules to those who even said an abbreviation or derivative of a swear word.
",2
"Over my experience, I have composed a list of what not to do in this game due to safety issues.
",4
"If you buy these with a credit card, you will become a big target for hackers who will steal your information.
",7
"Bullying Concerns: Even though there is bullying going on in the real world and online, there is a button called ""block a player"" or something along those lines which will block a player from communicating to you, and I believe there is an in-game mute button to mute players.
",3
"The prices for these extra things are not cheap either and will burn holes through your pockets.

"Builder's Club Membership is nice, but will make you a big target for hackers.

"They are really stupid in my opinion.

"Online-Dating Issues: Online Dating on Roblox has always been an issue around the 2011-2012 time period and is still going strong to this day.
",6
"Roblox may become a hotspot for sexual predators if it hasn't already since this game is becoming huge and popular.
",1
"The problem is that kids and teens will try to go out with someone they don't know.
",7
"They will never know who that person is until they meet them on the street, and after you meet them, you are screwed.
",7
"Word of advice, don't do it, and if someone tries to pressure you, then you need to block them and/or leave the game and go to a different server.
",7
"Overall Summary: This game isn't the game it used to be and gets a ton of hate due to its current state unfortunately.
",9
"Consumerism has taken a toll on the community and it seems that little to none care about the community anymore.
",2
"The updates Roblox comes out with are usually for the worst instead of the best.
",1
"Online-Dating is still a huge issue that many seem to either care or not care about.
",1
"As a person who's been playing Roblox since 2015, the website, in terms of censorship, is pretty good at censoring any and every word a child registered under 13 could type.
",1
"They used to have games that included naked models and such, but they've long since removed them all.
",6
"I prefer that only kids that are age 13 and above play this game.
",4
"It's not perfect for the under aged as there are many players who break the rules.
",4
"And those under aged kids might learn something bad from them.
",4
"The community is made up of many very strange people, and you will be concerned by the amount of things in it.
",1
"This game is supposed to be ""Family-Friendly,"" but it has no supporting qualities to make it that way.
",8
"When you make a new account, you start with NO money, and therefore can be bullied just because of your appearance.
",7
"This can emotionally distress children by making them think that they are worthless people, thus begging you to buy robux.
",3
"() Continuing the point, robux is VERY VERY VERY expensive.
",6
"It can nuke your wallet in basic terms.
",1
"() Some games in roblox can be violent for young kids.
",3
"Certain games might be worrisome for parents, like one called ""Murder Mystery.""
",9
"In that game, you have to either kill a murderer (as sheriff), kill everyone (murderer), or survive as long as you can.
",1
"This kind of theme is very extreme for young kids, and should be avoided if need be.
",3
"Many people incorrectly call this ""hacking.""
",1
"In case you are thinking, these exploits are illegal in roblox, and people can get banned from this.
",2
"The main problem, however, is that exploits can inject foreign scripts into a game that makes other avatars involuntarily make sex-like movements.
",8
"This is VERY disturbing to many people and the amount of exposure is insane.
",8
"Unfortunately, the report buttons around the site barely ever work, and you will have a hard time with customer service.
",6
"I have tried countless times to get an old, scammed account back.
",0
"Many inappropriate games and  images have actually gone through the system.
",8
"Even if moderation actually works, there's an even bigger problem.
",6
"Many of them are extremely inappropriate AND/OR clickbait (fake video).
",1
"These can leak into pretty much innocent children's lives and destroy everything.
",2
"If the children keep going through links in the videos, they can actually encounter many awkward things not related to roblox.
",3
"Kids can even be taken to an inappropriate twitter page!
",5
"However, ever since they have been removed, scams have increased what seems to be TENFOLD.
",2
"Scams can steal people's accounts, give them viruses, or spill the beans of their location.
",4
"More scams appear because kids are DESPERATE to get robux in any way they can.
",8
"(A common saying is to steal a parent's credit card)  Therefore, people attempt to scam as much as they possibly can.
",8
"These are usually taken down, but they always keep coming for more.
",2
"They work by giving people robux by going to phishing sites and completing offers, which are actual scams.
",5
"(It's illegal in roblox to get robux like this)

"
",0
"() There are no educational values in this game.
",4
"It's just a dump.
",7
"Don't give it a chance.
",5
"All of the other points I presenter are true and no matter what the official company says, it is pure poison to anyone who plays this game.
",9
"Overall, just buy a $100 lego set for your kids instead of giving them this pile of trash.
",7
"Fuel their minds instead of burning them to a crisp like the game has nearly done to me.
",2
"I have NO IDEA how  COPPA approved this game.
",5
"Many can say that the game is violent, but it really isn’t.
",2
"It’s just a game, it’s not like kids are learning to be criminals irl.
",6
"However, the safechat doesn’t limit everything that’s bad.
",7
"We can say curse words and stuff like that.
",1
"You can’t say numbers, which can be bad if you want to say “one of that” or “two please”.
",7
"Don't let your child play this game I played this game for about 3 years it is a materialistic game that basically made me feel that I was never good enough when you start off roblox with no ""robux"" (waste of money) you get called a ""noob"" and then you start to want robux so you buy some you try to blend in and look cool like the other players but now you get called an ""oder"" aka an online dater even though you don't look like a ""noob"" anymore you are cyberbullied even more.
",5
"So you buy more robux and this cycle continues people bully you no matter what because they are insecure and want to let it out on your children.
",9
"There are also sexual predators and online daters on this game, and to add to this people that want to find information about your children.
",7
"The oders will try to do sex stuff with your children like banging them and other stuff.
",0
"DO NOT GET THIS GAME.
",0
"This game gave me suicidal thoughts.
",6
"Warning to kids, teens, parents: This game is filled with lego porn that is allowed by moderators that is WAY worse than you think.
",3
"This website it supposed to be a kids websites but has the possibility to contain links to illegal images such as child pornography.
",8
"There are VERY BAD role models in this game.
",8
"If you let your kids place this they will most likely talk about porn and talk about body parts and sexual words.
",7
"There are also scams on the website that can in the worst case, STEAL your credit card number, there are also hackers/ exploiters that will most likely harass kids, curse, and put male and female private parts on people.

"If you don't believe anything I say, go try it for yourself, but I warn you, it's no place for kids or teens.
",5
"This game should be rated mature 17+ to adults only.
",3
"Roblox is not for kids.
",4
"The content that abounds on the website is not only over the top but also straight up volatile and disgusting.
",6
"The language is poorly moderated as both cuss words and sexual profanities are used pervasively along with racial slurs and anti protests.
",1
"Violence is found in mostly every game that the sight puts up and other more unknown games centralize on such violence i.e slitting throats, hangings, mass shooting, etc.
",2
"it’s pretty damn dark!
",1
"There is also sexual violence, such as “raping” though the act isnt actually happening it is heavily implied with dialogue and or certain emotes.
",1
"“Good Girls Sorority” uses sexual objectification of today’s reality shows to entice young teens to play it.

"Exploits also expose players to even worse sexual content such as pornagraphic images and in game models that look like dildos or genitalia.
",1
"Also drugs do occur, not as frequently as other inappropriate content but they are still there.

"Common sense media is way off with their rating of 10+!

"Exploiting: There is a system in the game that only makes it harder to exploit (Or hack) called FE and the two things i know that can bypass it is 1: a backdoor the way you can use a backdoor is to get access to a game such as like Hilton Hotels or something and place a script in witch will let u do things like Cuss or somethings, But its really hard to place backdoors into the front page games if you wanna avoid places that could have backdoors avoid (Spa games, Hotel games, games with little to no visits,

"Roblox has a pretty good filter system, its hard to  upload inappropriate decals, Its almost impossible to upload a inappropriate song, you almost can't say cuss words.

"There might be some people who will do nasty things on games like Adopt and raise a cute baby, or Meepcity.

"Roblox  has alot of scammers, to avoid getting scammed  don't give out your password to anyone, not even if it says Roblox approved or something, if you do join one of these games and it you see ""Roblox"" in the player list press esc (if on keyboard ) idk what it is on ipad and see if roblox is in the server.

"Every single time Roblox ends up on the news because someone's child was bullied or attacked or something the  parent did not 1.

"Didn't teach their child about online safety.

"But there is terrible moderation.

"I reported a scammer once and nothing happened.

"People could hack you, so be smart enough not to give out personal info.

"This is for immature 5 year olds, Nothing else to say.

"Some games are more violent then others.

"Some games have guns which is a con, but you could tell them not to play those games example of game with guns (jail break).

"Overall a good and entertaining game but extremely glitchy and makes my pc crash an awful lot and its got so bad now that I physically can not get onto the game to play with my friends while they are having fun on it I'm writing this review.

"I am very disappointed and upset that roblox have not bothered to fix this issue.

"Oh and also while I'm writing this review my friend just showed me that somebody on the game said something very inappropriate about self harm and it was not blurred out.

"This game is completely inappropriate and is giving kids bad messages and encouraging violence.

"So my conclusion is that this game is not appropriate and should not and I REPEAT should not be downloaded.

"Online Dating is an illegal field in roblox, though unfortunately does occur, though I don’t think your child will be affected.

"Roblox has various guns and loud noises in it as well as examples of cars crashing and death.

"Do remember that if you feel it is too graphic or you don’t want to let your child’s play it for other reasons, it is possible to send an email to roblox to terminate the account.

"Bullying is quite frequent on roblox, though this mainly occurs in roleplays.

"It prevents you from giving away personal information for kids that are younger and don't know how to protect themselves.

"Even without safechat, kids cannot swear, or say anything inappropriate.

"However, as any site on the internet, there is a shady part of it.

"And there are some dating cases, many people try to score girls on this, it is breaking the rules of Roblox.

"If anything, roblox is too strict.

"You can barely have a conversation without it being hashtagged, (at least if your account in under 13)

"As with any multiplayer game, there are people who are just not nice.

"Playing ROBLOX is an engaging experience that is only made better by social interactions, which is unfortunately a major downfall.

"SOME games, with an intense emphasis on SOME, are crawling with child predators or people who wish to harm your child.

"There are chat filters, which are often overly excessive, to prevent sharing of personal information and swearing, although some people do successfully circumvent these filters.

"My child saw an inappropriate game!

"Unfortunately, your child may come across these.

"However, situations can often turn worse simply because your child doesn't leave the game and report it to the administrators.

"People are swearing on ROBLOX!
",1
"Unfortunately, the chat filter on ROBLOX that prevents swearing can be easily circumvented.

"It also can block completely innocent words or phrases all together.

"Users who register their account under 13 are censored to even MORE innocent content, and even become discluded from getting a virtual job because they can't see nearly as many messages.
",4
"Children/Teens over this age can detect threats such as child predators easier, and aren't always as trusting and willing to give out personal information.
",1
"Many of the child predators' plots are successful because younger children don't recognize the potential danger and continue to talk to these people and even give out personal information, whereas those over 13 aren't as easily fooled.

"On many games, the amount of predators is over exaggerated, with only a few being the real issue.

"YOU should check the games before you let your kids play, the game has counter-measures for the bad stuff in it, but since everyone has free reign to post and create, keeping track is impossible, people look for loopholes cause theit terrible, but whats worse is parents not being careful and watching their kids, so when something goes wrong, they blame the closest thing that isnt them.

"(DISCLAIMER : I strongly recommend not playing Meep City) Yeah just pointing that out again.
",5
"Okay, moving on
",6
"All this innapropriate stuff parents talk about... Guys, Honestly!
",2
"Your child could look up bad stuff, worse than what's on Roblox and you might not even notice!
",7
"People say there is blood, but it's frankly only red blocks, and your character dying is merely only it saying ""oof"" and its all its body parts falling apart ( the red blocks don't occur in all games only some.)
",2
"If any parents are reading this review, please tell your kids that there are some scammers/hackers on Roblox.
",7
"Scammers usually say to other players ""get your free Robux"" and some unwary players get scammed by these people.
",5
"The scammers usually ask people for their passwords to add ""free Robux,"" and then, when the password is given, they just steal all of the unwary player's Robux.
",5
"Hackers are even worse.
",1
"Without you even knowing, hackers not only steal your Robux, but also steal in-game money.
",5
"This actually happened to my friend once.
",0
"Although scammers and hackers are rare, you could still get hacked.
",8
"Also, in some games, there is a little bit of violence, such as guns or killing, but this is very cartoonish, so I think even a 8 year old can handle this.
",3
"Of course, moderation can't be pristine clean and, if you have never been an admin of an online game with nearly millions of players, why are you sending advice for it?
",1
"The worst thing about this game is the absolute worshiping of money.
",9
"There is some nasty shit here keep your kids away.
",2
"Some games can be violent.
",3
"I know roblox does not allow cursing, and if u even try to curse, it blocks it out right away, but there is always a bypass or a way to make it work.
",1
"almost in every server there are some people saying innapropriate language and cussing.
",1
"something I saw a long time ago near 2015 was so insanse I don’t even think I could bring myself up to say it.
",0
"There were 2 kids or men in a sword fighting server spamming that “women are property.” Every time they would see a woman roblox avatar they would go up to it and tell them to get back in the kitchen or they would torture them by beating them.
",6
"and now there’s another problem with hackers and exploiters too.
",9
"Now u may be thinking, “oh what’s wrong with that?
",5
"They can do some pretty inappropriate things to your child while playing the game.
",7
"First of all, if they are an exploiter, they can run a script called the “bang command”.
",3
"It’s basically where the exploiter has sex with your child’s avatar, and everything is visible.
",2
"and the thing is, you can’t get out of it when the exploiter is doing it.
",2
"but don’t worry too much, because it’s not graphically detailed or anything.
",3
"another thing you should be worried about from hackers is that they can make porn wallpapers in the game and put them across the sky.
",6
"And heavily graphic nudity will be shows clearly.
",1
"well that’s probably the most a hacker can do to a child, but there’s more then hacking, and that is called online dating.
",8
"There are hundreds and thousands and maybe even millions of children online dating on roblox, unaware of who is behind the other screen.
",4
"so the point I’m trying to make is, is that this is not a child friendly game “AT ALL!”.
",4
"so I think a decent age would be 14 years and up, but under that NO WAYYYY!!!!!!
",4
"but again, only let your 14 year and up play if you trust them with all your heart to leave the server if anything innapropriate happens or just ignore it.
",7
"and if you do not trust your child, I would say that this is a 18+ Game.
",7
"However, I find that there are a few issues with the platform.
",1
"The first issue that I'd like to address is how greedy the site/app is.
",9
"Roblox has recently removed the ""guest"" feature, where you can play Roblox but cannot buy any in-game currency, talk, or save any data from any of the games within Roblox.
",6
"My second issue is that Roblox has a WHITELIST filter instead of a blacklist-type filter.
",1
"This means that many everyday words such as ""are"" and ""I"" sometimes get censored.
",1
"My name, Grace, gets censored.
",6
"The filter is also very easy to bypass, and users who set their age to be under 13 cannot see nor type any numbers.
",1
"The filter is also very easy to bypass and so many players like to curse unnecessarily.
",1
"It's ridiculous.
",0
"My third issue is that there is a lot of online dating, known by Roblox players as ODing, that goes on in certain games.
",8
"The only thing that ever actually happens in parties is ODing.
",4
"which I think shouldn't be happening because that is actually AGAINST THE RULES OF ROBLOX.
",2
"Many parents are led to believe that most of the players of Roblox are pedophiles who are looking to hurt your child in some way, but they are not.
",4
"And, besides, players can't even talk to you when you're not in the game if you don't send them a friend request or accept theirs.
",7
"You can also report them and Roblox will look at their chats and ban them if they've done something wrong.
",7
"How can parents expect a game without ANY pedophiles on it, anyway?
",2
"My fifth issue is that on Roblox, you have to buy Robux so that you can buy certain catalog items to be considered ""cool.""
",8
"Parents, if you don't want your child to be looked at than less worthy than a player who has bought Robux, you should just buy the five-dollar option which gives you 400 Robux.
",6
"You should not just buy a bunch of Robux for them all at once because, I know from experience, the person will FOR SURE recklessly spend it and will regret it later.
",6
"Your child's coolness will be out the roof if you decide to go with this.
",8
"Over one 20$ payment: Your child's coolness will be OUT THE ROOF with this much.
",8
"My last tip is that you shouldn't just take away their device altogether if you see that they're doing something bad.
",5
"Tell them that what they were doing could be harmful or that it is dangerous, and if you really want ant to delete Roblox, let them play Minecraft instead.
",7
"It is literally impossible but if they have an addiction to the game I recommend you take it away for a week or so because that really helps to sort of ""wake them up"" from their addiction.
",4
"Do not keep it away for too long, or else they could become very sad or angry for no reason for a while.
",7
"So yes, Roblox has a few issues that it could work out, but no game is perfect.
",6
"PEOPLE CAN DO RUDE STUFF BUT ITS FINE ON XBOX
",0
"However, many ""Reports"" on the news have made the game seem like an oversexualized violent content platform that parents should never let their children play, which is not true.
",6
"I blame completely the news for their lack of researching more deeply in these ""Sexual Content In Roblox"" reports, which in turn has given roblox a bad reputation.
",9
"It is true, that some sexual content has been reported, but it is removed so fast that unless a million viewers see it at once, it is almost never truly played by many people.
",7
"There have also been reports of ""Bullying"" and ""Sex Rooms"" in roblox, which are overdramatized of what they really are.
",1
"Sure, these projects EXISTED, but they were removed almost Immediately.
",9
"One recent report showed supposedly the aftermath of a sexual assault in a Roleplaying game, which actually was just the player being knocked down and jumped on, nothing else.
",0
"However, keep a SUBTLE eye (Don't start deleting friends unless its OBVIOUS they are pedophiles or some other creep.)
",5
"Update:
",0
"
",0
"This news article below supposedly talks about cyberbullying in roblox, and how to see if your child is a victim: http://www.wsmv.com/story/38541194/popular-educational-app-not-immune-t…
",2
"
",0
"However, as with many news articles (Who, IMO have very little  knowledge when it comes to the real Internet) they explain very poorly how to detect if your child is being bullied Roblox, such as being concerned if your child is Laughing at the screen (Which, can mean ANYTHING other than bullies.
",7
"I don't like the Violence and my parents hate the Safety.
",0
"My parents say there is not much Safety in the game.
",2
"I also don't like on how people call eachother ""Noobs'.
",3
"You can't put numbers in safe chat.
",1
"You can join groups but some groups annoy me like Gravity Gymnastics.
",3
"They always ingnore me and the Tryouts and Practices are at night cause its summer.
",0
"You can egt reported but your not banned even when your online dating and I wish it could be different.
",8
"But one thing that I wish to do is criticize the game's .
",5
"When the forums were up, many people were attacking others, and no one liked anyone.
",9
"If you expressed you opinion, they would hate on you and be mean.
",7
"When I was new to the forums, I didn't know all of the stupid abbreviations they used, so the stupid people of the  forums claimed I'm an attention seeker, even though I kept trying to apologize for not knowing what ""PA"" (personal attack) meant.
",4
"One person even went to my YouTube channel and called me an attention seeking motherf**ker, a f**got, etc..
",0
"In response to the forumers being cruel, the mods took down the forums because they were ""prone to excessive abuse"".
",2
"Also, one time, I was playing a game, and someone started insulting my religion (Judaism).
",0
"I begged them to stop, but they wouldn't.
",3
"They made racist jokes, and bully everyone.
",9
"I called them racist and left the game, but they proceeded to tell their friends lies, making their friends send me absolutely awful messages, like someone calling me a pig, someone telling me to hang myself, someone telling me i'm worthless, etc.
",0
"This caused depression, which didn't last long, because they apologized, and I forgiven them (and shouldn't have).
",9
"It's kind of sad that a 16 year old would act like this, but this is the internet for you.
",2
"Also, the moderation is absolutely awful.
",2
"Unless you give a reason why a user should be punished that is a million pages long, roblox will often not do anything.
",2
"I MYSELF got banned for anti-online dating in the forums (when they were up).
",0
"Also, just to mess with the mods and make their lives 10 times harder, some people post pornographic places.
",2
"Just to mess with the mods and anger them, which is just annoying.
",9
"So make sure your children are careful while playing this game.
",7
"Also, there are some ads for sex simulators.
",1
"Some people might even go to great extents to quitting Roblox due to excessive R15.
",2
"Most people who play on this are a bunch of five year olds on their Mum/Mom's computer however, parents, please be warned as this game contains online daters, people who swear like this:
",4
"t
",0
"h
",0
"i
",0
"s
",0
"
",0
"so be warned, and also there are many murder mystery games and scary content, much consumerism and I stumbled across a drinking game.
",8
"This game is a waste of time to play, there are only a few good games on here.
",2
"Well, first, it's hard to get Robux (the currency in ROBLOX) without begging a parent to cough up money, and there's a 99% chance they will say no, unless your parents don't care.
",7
"This pretty much leads to players calling players ""noobs"" just because of their appearance.
",4
"I know that ROBLOX needs money, but they shouldn't make ROBUX hard to obtain.
",2
"Also, some people have ""it"" in the game and it's inappropriate.
",1
"I wish in the game Hospital Life 2 where you can be a doctor or a patient they should NOT have other things you can buy with robux on the side.
",8
"I bought a dog for 150 robux and got it but, when i left and then came back to the game the dog was gone so ot ripped me off with 150 robux I could use for another game!
",0
"I have almost never seen any inappropriate or sexual instances, but a friend of mine has heard something disturbing A SINGLE TIME, but he was reported and banned almost instantly.
",0
"The whole thing about how the filters don't work?
",1
"The filters censor any way to fool the system, due to them censoring words that:
",1
"
",0
"1: Don't make sense/not words
",1
"
",0
"2: Numbers
",0
"
",0
"3: Symbols
",0
"
",0
"4: Singular letters besides A, I, ai, and acronyms like brb or sos.
",9
"The whole thing about killing people and weapons?
",3
"And yes, occasionally the filters glitch out and someone swears in anger, but 
",1
"usually he will get reported or get what siblings are supposed to do to each other, IGNORED.
",0
"And if you dislike your child VERY RARELY seeing something SLIGHTLY inappropriate, then don't let him/her use the internet at all.
",7
"But parents, if you want to raise that kid in school that can't play the most popular video game in school, then go right ahead, soccer mom.
",7
"But why spend the money on something your kids will just grow out of?
",7
"Now that I'm older I think it's a waste of time, it isn't worth your money to get that stuff.
",6
"I mean it's just not worth getting attached to it, I think that I should've never got the game, just because it is addicting.
",6
"I have deleted the game off all of my devices and have ignored my friends on roblox.
",0
"I don't want to have any thing to do with it anymore.
",7
"TIRED OF SCAMS?
",0
"So parents, only watch out for scams, but, other than that, nothing is really inappropriate.
",2
"It has a hallway with a puddle of blood and once you get to the end of the hall, there is a black mass that you have to walk through and you teleport to another area.
",2
"Behind that black mass, there is a person killing another person and there is blood; but you only see it for a split second and then you teleport, but you usually don’t see it unless the game keeps you behind the black mass for a moment.
",7
"There are also some (barely) games that have sexual stuff in them, but that isn’t really a big problem because there are barely any games that are sexual.
",8
"One thing that is a big problem on ROBLOX that parents should be aware of is something called ODing.
",2
"One thing I forgot to list was that some people troll, and most trollers swear or say things like, “DIE FROM AIDS” or, “YOU WILL DIE ALONE.” There are plenty of trollers out there that swear.
",1
"It blocks out all words they think could be inapropriate with hashtags.
",1
"In this game, I haven't discovered any issues in the games or the site, other than abysmal moderation and lack of any real contact with the moderators.
",1
"Yes, every review says that Roblox is terrible, but lets remember that these reviews all come from naive parents who just took at least three glances at the game.
",2
"They haven't even seen the game enough to understand it  themselves.
",5
"Most games also have Nightclubs where players are dragged into drinking, getting high, and doing very adult things, It is also very expensive some games and items cost Robucks which have to payed for with real money..
",8
"If you don't look ""Cool"" You are called a"" NOOB"" which means you look basic and you are poor.
",8
"I mean who wants their 9 year old dating some random person on a game and learning things they shouldn't be?
",4
"Some games have violence and maybe a little bit of blood but if your kid is not scared of things like that then let them play.
",3
"However there are some bypasses, and the chat filtering system is broken.
",1
"Children can online date but online dating is against their rules and so is swearing.
",2
"Anyway on with the review,
",9
"There are things on here called ""ODers"" do NOT talk to these people.
",2
"They are the fire at the community's fabric.
",8
"If you don't want your child to see this, don't let them play ROBLOX, because they're everywhere.
",7
"While I love roblox, your kid may not like the bad graphics.
",7
"I don't care about graphics to be honest, so yeah.
",3
"This costs money.
",6
"Free Robux scams exist.
",8
"These will scam you out of time and your child's account.
",5
"DO NOT DO FREE ROBUX SCAMS.
",0
"Some things that are wrong here is that there's too much MONETIZATION.
",2
"(The currency of the game which is overpriced in my opinion)"".
",6
"Another thing is that some games can depict violence and goriness, but you can clearly see it in the game title.
",2
"This can be somewhat dangerous as younger players may share their personal information (age, birthdate, location, etc).
",8
"Ok to begin with they block i love you but if you say i hate you it left unblocked.
",3
"Also the D*** word is also left unblocked.
",1
"Your allow to call people noobs and the games on there promote violence.
",4
"The report system does not work like they should 
",1
"  With all this being said Roblox is not a kid friendly game at all
",0
"Roblox is a really cringe .
",6
"I strongly advise you to not play it However, if you do find yourself playing dat game you should be precocious.
",5
"There are predators and online daters.
",2
"Roblox is now crappy.
",6
"There is a chat bubble glitch that is SUPER annoying.
",1
"Roblox's tag system is bad.
",1
"Roblox should only tag swear words and words that are not okay for kids to hear.
",1
"How come its not ok to say ""stop"" while it is ok to say the h word.
",1
"They are also money hungry, and want people to buy robux.
",6
"Roblox needs help.
",9
"I've been playing Roblox for 2 years now and i haven't see any 18+ stuff, and parents NEVER EVER believe about these paedo predator on news, It's BFF (Big fat fake), You can't really say inappropriate stuff on roblox because the filter is EXTREMELY STRICT even broken!
",2
"The bad part is robux is too expensive, yes i have BC my dad bought me BC because i finished exam, But i think you should also buy robux  BUT DON'T USE CREDIT CARD!
",4
"I played phantom forces once and Oof brigade cte and they are really violent there is so much blood.
",3
"Phantom forces there is tons of blood and i once took a screenshot but there was blood everywhere and a pile of dead bodies.
",0
"I wouldn't recommend phantom forces but just be aware; some games are violent, some aren't.
",3
"Unfortunatley, for me, my mum doesn’t like me playing the games with guns.
",0
"Why doesn’t she like games with guns?
",0
"I told her that they don’t have blood and gore but she won’t listen!
",0
"And in some games, the chat filter is not available for some words and you can still swear.
",1
"Plus there can be online daters and scamming on it.
",8
"The game is free but people will make fun of you if you don't have money.
",7
"Back in 2009 up till 2015 people were swearing and calling people names and all that stuff, but that stopped after roblox just ruined it and made it really boring (You can't even say 1 or 0ne) anyways I found it fun back then but now it is boring with the new tech and things they added.
",0
"however it moves up fast back in 2009 When I started the game was trash compared to now but it was so fun and had better things to do and a lot more things to do now they have planes and helicopters just like real life but in those times they almost did not have cars, the cars were so bad but fun.
",9
"Roblox is a great gaeme, especialy since it can help kids practice building and code, but, the game has some bad parts.
",6
"nuber one, if you have a young kid, DO NOT LET THEM PLAY THIS GAME.
",3
"the reason why is because often older kids who dont have anything beter to do with there lifes lie to pick on and be jerks to little kids, whitch is really mean.
",8
"also whatch what your kids play as well, because most of what is on the most played game page are just viloence games where you try to shoot and kill people, whitch can not only make you rage if you have a bad temper whitch is bad, it teaches you bad life values to.
",8
"and try to have a ad blocker or builders club, because the ads from other sites, are often viruses, and are bad.
",2
"Me as a teen, i have seen some stuff NOT good for younger ones, some online pervs can be on here as well.
",2
"And i have been bullied by random people ALMOST everytime ive been on the site
",6
"Remember to not fall for scam comments you can find everywhere.
",5
"Unfortunately, the community is what dumbs down the precious quality Roblox could've achieved.
",9
"Some pottymouths sneak in profanity through the filter.
",3
"""Pros"" call other noobs.
",4
"Unfair players ruin the fun by killing others repeatedly.
",1
"There's a reporting function, but many see it as ineffective.
",2
"And probably the chances are you won't find Online Daters or Predators on ROBLOX.
",8
"Chances are you guys have went looking for trouble and found it.
",0
"Then going to Common Sense Media and making ROBLOX look like the enemy.
",2
"If you don't want your snowflake getting his/her feelings hurt keep them away from those games!
",7
"And games with innapropriate content.
",1
"But within creation the user will get banned and his game with the innapropriate content will be gone within a DAY!
",3
"And maybe stop getting butthurt about bullying.
",7
"Please reconsider making this game look terrible.
",4
"If someone starts to cyber-bully you, just ignore them and leave the game.
",7
"Click on everything and set it as No one so no one can communicate with you/your child.
",5
"But, I would rather let my child play Murder Mystery 2 rather than a Adopt and Raise or Club game.
",0
"I would not let my child have s**, but I would rather them play a murder game (Yes, that sounds weird.
",3
"Like there's people who want to date you and meet up with you, who could possibly a pedophile is who you're meeting up with.
",8
"Also, the community is too salty.
",2
"I think you should see your child play this game.
",7
"Game like Phantom forces, Bloodfest, Murder mystery 2, and in 1 game called ""Redwood prison"" there was a death penalty area where you electrocute criminals in a chair, although it was removed.
",6
"Also you got to know that paedophiles are active in online dating games and how you can spend in app purchases for robux, but you can also earn items by doing things in all events.
",6
"To top it all off you can say words like ""Hell"" and hackers can possibly get into your account.
",8
"If you are a parent who does not want to expose your child to the ""bad"" parts of the world, be my guest.
",7
"Unfortunately you cannot delete accounts but you can probably block ROBLOX from the computer if you have that type of software.
",7
"Yep it sounds cruel, but that's probably the easiest way to get your child's account ""deleted"".
",9
"Getting banned is pretty hard in this 'game' now that they don't have forums.
",6
"However, the 'creator' of MeepCity got rid of the actions allowing this and also made sure that you couldn't name parties anymore (since those were the main problems in the game causing sexual acts).
",9
"Now if you're confused, ROBLOX is not a game.
",7
"(The majority of online dating, however, is simply harmless roleplaying, but some of it is malicious and therefore it should be avoided.)
",2
"There are lots of games with violence and death, such as Jailbreak ( has the guns and such), Phantom Forces (it has lots of guns and stuff), Murder Mystery 2, Counter Blox Roblox Offensive, and Assassin!
",8
"There is death in almost every ROBLOX game where 'resetting' ('killing' your character so they return back to spawn point) is not disabled.
",6
"The death is very cartoony and simple, your character just 'falls' down and has their limbs and head detached from the torso.
",2
"For example, in Murder Mystery 2 if I remember clearly when you are hit by a knife you will fall down like a real death, but I don't think there's any blood.
",8
"However players in those games may make it potentially slightly violent.
",8
"So in reality, it was CommunitySift's fault cursing was allowed to go through.
",0
"There is lots of consumerism in this one, but it is never required.
",8
"Also here are some games I recommend avoiding:
",2
"0  Life in Paradise--OD'ing
",1
"0   Any 'Adopt a Baby' or 'Make a Family' or any titles of that sort  games--there is OD'ing (BUT ""Adopt Me!""
",1
"Then I told her I was a girl since I was dressed as a boy (remember I was trolling or if you don't know what trolling is think of pranks) and she instantly left the server :'D)
",0
"
",0
"People can be mean in any game as long as it has chatting.
",1
"Unfortunately that is just the world we live in now but rude people aren't too common actually unless you are in a game that involves fighting, then they may be common.
",8
"If you want a more moderated 'game', this is not the game for you.
",7
"I'm honestly really disappointed in the ROBLOX community!
",0
"I've been playing this game for about 2-3 years now and not much has changed, if anything its gotten worst.
",6
"I don't even think the ROBLOX admins are worried about whats going on!
",7
"I always see people either getting bullied or online dating in every server something is always going on.
",5
"People will be making fun of new players or ""noobs"" people will be sharing their age or other personal info its not right, ROBLOX needs to do something about this!
",7
"Innocent players will get banned or in trouble for such ridiculous reasons too!
",8
"This is why I quit ROBLOX, and i regret every penny i've spent on this horrible game!
",6
"I really don't recommend this game to anyone and I think parents should watch out for it.
",4
"People on Roblox are disgusting they pretend to have s*x on a bed and they are only like 8!
",0
"These people are calleds ""oders"".And I could tell they are because they spelled many words wrong and they keep saying ""don't tell mom"".
",5
"Also many cyber bullys (again 8 year olds) they always make fun of you if you don't have ""robux"" and call each other noobs.
",7
"there is but it doesn't work.
",2
"The mods suck.
",1
"I can't believe this new generation.
",5
"A lot of people do like to have sex on games, someone tried to have it with me, I left immediately.
",0
"So much online daters and swearers that I have screenshotted and saved to my files for an upcoming video of it being  100% wrong to do.
",9
"It is so easy for scammers just to steal accounts cause when a ""Free robux"" Game shows up on the front page sometimes they take an hour just to get banned... Also when you report someone it does nothing soooooo yeaaaaahhhh.
",7
"I was completely shocked at the rudeness of this game.
",5
"The characters look rude and I saw someone say willy and bum.
",5
"Disgraceful!
",0
"The worst it the cafes like dunkin donuts which encourages unhealthy eating.
",7
"I am appalled by the horrible app
",2
"Roblox has WAY too much Cussing, Violence, and cyberbullying .
",2
"I think before you let your kids go free into Roblox you should talk to your kids about some stuff they should participate in, as sometimes you can find ODers, which are usually harmless except for the things they participate in, you should just prevent your kids from ODing; you also can find gun games, which you should make sure your kids can handle as some have (fake and non-realistic) blood.
",7
"These are pretty over-priced but worth it as sometimes people get bullied for not having Robux; but only by the spoiled brats.
",1
"If a player swears their message gets censored with hashtags but their filter is a bad one, such as censoring the letter I sometimes, and sometimes you can work around it, but kids under 13 can't type numbers normally or using workarounds like dec(number).
",1
"You can turn off chat but this cuts off the main part of the game, the social part.
",9
"Lots of people will say internet slangs such as lol, etc, some of these slangs also have inappropriate words contained inside the slang but, Roblox doesn't censor those so it's up to you to decide if you should consider those acronyms bad words.
",1
"If you or your child decide to be a creator it's important you look at the TOS because you can accidently get a warning, and in more worse cases a ban by doing something you didn't even know was a bad thing to do, such as uploading a copyrighted asset, uploading a decal with unreadable text; which is stupid, because sometimes text isn't supposed to be readable; or uploading a decal with a url; those things at the top of your screen right now that says a different thing depending on what website you're on ri

"Hi, I’m 11 years old and SHOCKED!
",0
"By how roblox is... it is innapropriate and way to weird.
",1
"When I was 9 and playing this some player thought I was an adult and said “i wanna have *** with you!” Then 2 years later I came back just hoping to shrug it all off.
",0
"And all those mean players were back.
",8
"Then I ended things off with this hacker bully then I was locked out of my account and I tried to reset it but only my old email was set up on it.
",0
"Pretty sure that hacker got me.
",0
"And they are all scams since they said “Username and Password Please” which then in the Roblox game “An employee won’t ask for a password or a full credit card number.” Then I gave the idea of creating a kids version of roblox which would make you take a photo to determine age.
",7
"So Minecraft was created in 6 days... but roblox can’t do anything about this.
",0
"Really if you do think this will teach your kid something... it will.
",7
"By teaching them the online dangers and also wait... teaching them about pedifiles.
",7
"So from a kid to a parent.. DONT LET YOUR KID PLAY THIS!
",7
"Dont listen to “great reviews!
",6
"Totally reccomend.” Also kids if your reading this and thinking to play roblox... there are more like me that have had this horrible experience.
",7
"We all don’t want this to keep happening
",2
"I had no account for a long time and I had fun even without having to talk to other players, but as ROBLOX  changed over the years I finally signed into a 13+ account that I could now use to talk to others, but when I did, most of every server or game I went to had a raging argument between confused children threatening each other, or it could even be some adult predator and we'd never know it.
",0
"Some situations you'd find on ROBLOX would contain serious amounts of lego porn and hacked images of imagery that should not be shown to children but rarely is so, and kids join those games because they know their parents can't stop them when given the advantage, so they perform sex acts with other players online and so on.
",4
"I'll tell you one story about me joining Natural Disaster Survival, one of the old, but really popular games on ROBLOX and this is when porn images were bad at the time.
",0
"When I joined the game, an image was shown on everyone's screen as they overreacted and chose to not leave the game, giving the exploiter the reaction his perverted mind wanted.
",0
"Anyways, this was back when sex on ROBLOX was so bad and it still is, but these attacks on kids are really rare now, but still can be found on ROBLOX.
",0
"You have a bunch of confused teens and children trying to act like some bad ass and f*** around with others for no reason and it's bad.
",2
"Now off of the sex part, let's go into the violence and language.
",8
"ROBLOX tries their best to censor a lot of things, but doesn't give a crap on the violence, so you will find explicit violent horror/war games at some points with realistic gore and so on.
",3
"In my opinion, ROBLOX is the most offensive and sexual video game ever made without even being a bad game at all.
",1
"If they are some perverted teen, take this game away from them immediately, but if not let them have at it as long as they are not bullying and getting along just fine on there, able to get across things they should not have to anyways.
",7
"The chatbox must also be taken away for a long time, so the child can't talk to strangers online.
",7
"well first of all i'm really sick of seeing all of this whining about all of the horrible things that happen in roblox.
",9
"theres going to be bad things in all games.
",2
"i know all of these parents are uneducated probably just going off of other peoples reviews.
",2
"the whole swearing thing... well in roblox you cant even say numbers, the chat filters are too strict but everyone keeps saying they need to be better.
",1
"Its to kid friendly.Its just lego looking people walking around.
",7
"(plus its a noob game)
",3
"It has some violence but not that much.
",3
"Parents may think roblox is bad but there thinking in the wrong way.
",2
"The only thing I must admit I don't agree with is that children can use it by themselves.
",1
"PS: It's also very annoying cause the only way to have fun is actually spending money to buy the virtual currency ""Robux"" so if you don't have really good economic status then better not.
",6
"If they do just tell them to unfriend the guy/girl that asked.
",5
"Roblox is strait up NOT safe for children.
",8
"I really don’t think their safe chat works right.
",1
"Like there are probably murders on this sight.
",4
"(This is what I think of the art of roblox if you don’t want to read this part just skip to this heart)♥️ The graphics of Roblox is just gross.
",3
"In my opinion the faces are kinda weird.
",7
"Like if you want kids to want this game maybe make the faces more ummm well... maybe make the faces Maori if a realistic simplified version cause ummmm I think that faces that have the eyes to close to mouth are just plain bad looking.
",7
"And yes I have seen umm stuff in this game like uhhhh gross things that make me wanna throw up.
",0
"Just saying this game (i’m Talking about Roblox) is just strait up the worst game EVER for kids.
",8
"Negatives:
",0
"People get away for swearing like if hello was a bad word people could get away with saying it by saying: hexlxllo.

"Also it's full of bullies a lot of the time and some games are violent...
",2
"The robux prices do concern me...

"It will never appear on the front page and you will never be able to find it unless you specifically search for it.

"There are some hackers that can glitch the game, and constantly kill you and stuff.

"Here are some downers with the players.
",1
"If you've ever heard of a role play game, some people can take it a bit too far.
",2
"Usually people will keep things PG, but i've seen some pretty crazy things.
",2
"One last thing, Roblox is consistent of many violent games and contains many violent games such as phantom forces, a first person shooter, murder mystery, and many other horror games with disturbing images, not porn but like dead bodies and stuff like that.

"Only some games are violent (murder mystery, mad murderer, jailbreak, zombie rush, etc).

"I strongly believe that your children should be at least 12+ to play this game.

"But (and there's the dreaded word of parents) it can also have a bad side.

"Whenever I play roblox, I find a lot of bad and good stuff.

"First of all, there is waaayyyyy too much bullying and hating.

"I have seen players call other people things far worse than what is allowed.

"Second, I have also noticed in some games that there is a lot of gross, nasty, and horrible sexting and uh... Use your imagination.

"I also have found out that in roblox, I find a lot of people swearing.

"I can get you some for free, Just give me your password"" I also find websites called that promote a fake way to get free robux also known as: ""Robux Generators""  These websites are NOT safe for your children, as they often ask for your roblox password or ask for you to do a survey.

"roblox is a cool platform with decent games, but around half of the community is bad, the other half probably isn't, as the bad half normally would swear and call you names in the chat, uncommonly some people would online date and probably pretend to have sex, but you can configure the permissions of communication through account settings so that you wouldn't see the chat, so that you (or your son) probably won't suddenly have bad behaviour from playing games in this platform or something like that.

"- Online Daters (although Roblox ### it, players have found ways to go around it)
",1
"- Violents (Some games such as Murder Mysery 2, Phantom Fources And More)

"- Scam Games (These games ask for passwords, Roblox usually removes them but sometimes they don’t, so you have to report them)

"- Exploiters & hackers (some kids and teenagers have downloaded hacks onto their computers, some may be a virus, if you are a parent, make sure you check on

"Firstly, some people can bully people and be mean to them, and even hack them or find their IP address.

"Secondly, most games have a violent concept and story.

"Yes, there is sex and non kid-friendly things in this game, but it's easy to avoid these kinds of things.
",2
"If someone walks up to you and says something dirty, then all you gotta do is walk away!

"Kids should know that they are not supposed to give away information about themselves, so it's mostly their fault for ever doing that.

",6
"There are still games to play; I'm not trying to say Roblox is absolute trash or anything.
",9
"Well, if someone is bullying you, don't be sad!
",7
"The game also has some violence in games like Phantom Forces.
",3
"Obviously you have some kids who are immature and make inappropriate jokes, but this happens very rarely and the person is often reported and given proper punishment from the moderation team.
",1
"As for me, I have never encountered really anything very bad besides a few jerks that called me names such as ""noob"", which has grown popular on the site and in media in general, but they usually back off before it escalates any further.
",3
"Swearing is not allowed, though the only problem is is that users can also mask the word by putting in random characters or placing a character that looks like the letter.

"I spend 25 hours a day playing this and spent hundreds of dollars on this game!!!!

"BUT don't let them stay there are so many better and more creative games out there.

"There is also a LOT of inappropriate games on the website.

"I've played this game for a while there is nothing bad but is kinda violent with guns and swords there's no blood  but one of the games has the word that says s##t but block the texting and talking on there it's nothing like call of duty or grand theft auto so kids 8 and up can play
",8
"But there is PG violence and has scary horror games on there.
",3
"The game can let you do very horrible stuff in roleplay, which many kids under the age of 13 do.

"Sometimes the online dating looks like a very healthy friendship but it turns worse.

"In ROBLOX Studio, everything is not doing what it's supposed to.

"In ROBLOX Player, after being idle for less than 30 seconds, I cannot move.

"Another example, everything is glitchy.

"In 2015, roblox got bad.
",0
"Now roblox is full of inappropriate people, swearing, trolls, etc.
",2
"Back in 2014 there were lots of inappropriate and gross “S3X PARTY” games.

"Roblox is obsessed with money and is now a boring cash grab.

"I quit roblox in sep 2017.
",6
"I played roblox for 6-7 years now I quit.
",0
"Roblox also has pedophiles and stuff
",8
"But the problem with the front page is 90% of the games there are either noob-infested or OD’er-infested.
",3
"OD’er-infested include MeepCity, Adopt and raise a cute kid (I don’t think it’s on the front page but still)
",3
"
",0
"I’ve only been playing for a year, and I can’t name all of the bad things I have learned from this site.
",9
"It has a terrible community.
",6
"They closed the forums because the forums were not bringing a positive environment to Roblox, but it’s really Roblox’s fault.
",0
"Ever since the forum merge in 2017, Roblox has increased thousands and thousands of more toxicity.

"And then they are going to blame us for something we didn’t do?
",7
"Are too lazy to do there job

"Can’t take criticism
",1
"Some parents complain about the games that have too much graphical content, like Murder Mystery 2 (which consists of a murderer who needs to ""get rid"" of everyone and a sherrif who needs to get rid of the murderer).
",8
"You still should be wary, as even though Roblox has censorship in it's chat, you can still bypass it.
",1
"Moderators do a fairly good job at removing Free Robux scams and any sexual games, but still aren't perfect, such as dealing with reports.
",1
"Just stay wary of anything, and still report stuff that is innapropriate.
",8
"If you don’t take time out of your day and teach your kids the do’s and don’t’s on the internet, this game is not worth you or your child’s time.
",7
"There are a bunch of older people on ROBLOX who try to talk little kids into getting their private information.
",4
"Your child should know never to give out private information on the internet in the first place.
",7
"On ROBLOX, there are these users in ROBLOX called “scammers”.
",1
"These users try to scam your child into clicking links that could give you viruses on your computer.
",5
"The things that they usually try to scam your child for is Robux (the in-game currency).
",5
"This brings us to the next reason ROBLOX isn’t as good as it used to be, the consumerism.
",6
"I honestly think ROBLOX got greedy with the money because they removed it on April 15, 2016.
",6
"A lot of people got upset after that because paying for the Robux was too much money to spend on a game.
",6
"I honestly think that the lowest BC isn’t a lot of money considering that it lasts a month.
",9
"Some people go a little too deep into the role-play and start asking their partner if they want to do the “dirty dirty”.
",7
"The best thing to do is to just leave the game because your child could be talking to a 56-year old man and not know it.
",7
"Since this is a kid’s game, you are probably wondering how people can say stuff like that.
",5
"There is only one way to answer that and that’s to bypass the chat filter.
",1
"People will replace and arrange letters in cuss words to bypass the chat filter ROBLOX has set up.
",1
"Examples: “fk u” and “sht”.
",0
"It’s the beginning of 2018 and this still is a huge problem.
",9
"Usually, you shouldn’t run into this problem because of safe chat.
",2
"The violence in the game isn’t really much of a problem.
",2
"There are games like Zombie Rush and Blood Fest that have guns and violence in them.
",3
"There are also games like Paintball which also have violence in it.
",8
"A lot of parents have been complaing about the “exploiters” and the report abuse button.
",7
"The exploiters are just people who want to ruin the experience for your child, same with “trollers”.
",9
"There is nothing that you can do to stop them and they are going to continue so just let ROBLOX moderators do their job and let them handle the task at hand.
",7
"Parents are saying that their children are getting banned from ROBLOX for nothing reason or the moderators haven’t done anything.
",9
"ROBLOX has about 2 million players and I don’t think the moderators could solve all those reports in one whole day.
",6
"Give them time to do their job and I’m sure your child got banned for a reason.
",7
"They always give you reasons of why you got banned.
",7
"ROBLOX is supposed to power your child’s imagination but if your child uses their imagination for the wrong thing then that’s when things go wrong.
",7
"I tried and tried but it wont let me i logged out to test my new password when i inserted it it would not let me on my account i think this is a waste of time to work for something then have it taken by a PASSWORD!?!?
",0
"!I really hope that kids should not play a game that lies about what this is really about.
",2
"This happened a first time on my other account but then i created this one and i forgot my password so i wrote another to try out and i don't want this to happen to others and this is a addicting game but kids should look the other way from this game cause then they want it on phones and even on my PHONE?!
",0
"has porn and sxuality,  block this website!
",3
"Number 1 is that roblox's moderation is ABSOLUTELY horrid.
",2
"Late 2017 people said that the report system didn't work , but they fixed it around the middle of 2017 .
",1
"The reason is people have been reported getting banned for no good reason, like for instance saying  yes and hi!
",6
"Now when you say a cuss word then it comes out like this ""####"" , but roblox is so strict about now that you aren't allowed to even say numbers!
",1
"Roblox does absolutely nothing about this issue because the most popular game called Meepcity,  A ripoff of Toontown and Club Penguin has attracted the most Online Daters and caused the Filter to be strict.
",4
"However roblox does have downsides: ODers*, account scammers, hackers, WAY TOO STRONG filtering (It Is so strong that you cant say stuff like numbers, long words, etc).
",1
"Roblox founders and famous developers are VERY greedy about money, and they are repeatedly overpricing robux (the main currency since tix, a currency you EARN, got removed in 2016 April), making hats and gears WAY TOO expensive.
",9
"They also support rich ODers and just ban poor ODers, but at least that is better than not banning both of them.
",6
"Hello everyone,
",0
"
",0
"I've noticed many parents have left bad reviews off Roblox, however having played this game for several years now I have witnessed the community AND moderators become worse.
",0
"The game is fine by itself but the problem is when parents say there is violence it is because the entire game is user based with very little games made by the Roblox staff themselves.
",2
"Many of the online interactions on Roblox are fine and there are great people on there, but when your child is playing the wrong games (mostly role playing games and club based games) online interactions become worse.
",2
"This is why many parents leave bad reviews on this game.
",2
"All concerns can apply to this game, but only because of the community and since most games are user generated that applies to violence too...
",2
"It has a system that if  anyone swears, when they post it, immediate action takes place and it gets blocked, with hashtags.
",4
"Another concern is that it is user-generated, because sadly guests were removed, so the only way to get on is making an account, which I reccomend putting your email so you don’t forget your password.
",8
"There are a lot of scammers, so be careful, whatever you do, do NOT fall for people asking your password and saying they will give you “robux” , the only thing they’re giving you is a hacked account because they will then login and you will be kicked off your account, and they will change your password and use any robux you have.
",5
"And the games too, they are all fake.
",2
"Some hackers are able to make a fake chat by making up random usernames in chat and making them say things like “I can’t believe this worked!
",8
"They also add admins like builderman and ROBLOX, but don’t fall for it.
",5
"The drinking, drugs and smoking is also another thing that luckily if people type any of these words, it gets blocked and replaced with hashtags, but people still bypass this.
",1
"The currency is called Robux by the way, when I’ve been talking about it, and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a free way of getting robux, no matter how much it looks real, 99.00 percent of the time, it’s fake, and there is only 1.00 percent chance it is real.
",2
"Sometimes, these events are horrible, such as shootings and major crimes, and sometimes they are good, such as major breakthroughs.
",1
"The difference between ROBLOX and the news is that when something ""good"" happens in ROBLOX, (such as a new game comes out) nobody really cares, because again, who would?
",2
"When something bad happens, such as a child predator report comes in, then it's big news because now it's becoming a ""real issue"".
",1
"What I am trying to say is, I think many people are only focusing on the bad parts of ROBLOX (which i will admit there are a few things) and are oblivious to the good things that happen.
",1
"The fear of pedophiles and child predators may be on your mind.
",7
"In games like these, you don't usually have to deal with child predators.
",3
"However, you do have to deal with issues such as people swearing, ""too much violence"", and possibly ""too much drinking/drugs/smoking"" references as well.
",8
"This is where the issue ""too much sex"" can occur.
",8
"I haven't played many RP games, so my opinion on this issue may not be as well thought out as my other opinions, and they might be biased because many players that play action games actually find RP games as stupid.
",4
"(I'm sure many RP gamers think action games are stupid as well) But anyway, from what I've seen and heard from my friends that play these type of games and myself, this hardly ever occurs.
",2
"But I think it's another one of those cases where the good things are overlooked, and the bad things (again such as sex being imitated in the game) are over focused on.
",8
"Never the less, this is still an on going issue that I constantly hear about.
",8
"Many people blame it on the ""crappy chat filter system"", and how it isn't  very good at doing it's job.
",1
"There are many people that think ROBLOX is going overboard with the chat filtration system (especially safe chat), and that there are too many blocked words that should be allowed to be said.
",1
"Also remember there are phrases that have double meanings, which makes it frustrating when you want to use phrase in an innocent manner, but it keeps getting blocked.
",8
"On the other hand, there are many people that think ROBLOX's chat system isn't good enough, and that the filter does a bad job filtering out words that shouldn't be used on a video game targeted towards kids.
",1
"Unfortunately, it is near impossible to block every bad word, and all of the alternative ways of saying it.
",1
"For example, saying the ""s word"" will be blocked, but saying ""sh9t"" isn't.
",1
"Even if ROBLOX does find a way to filter each and every bad word and alternative way of saying it, there is still that other group of people who want the chat filter to be removed, and this will most likely stir a lot of people up, or cause many players to just leave.
",1
"On top of this, there is the ""reporting"" issue.
",8
"Many people think this report system doesn't work, because many people get reported on, but nothing ever happens to them.
",2
"(I've been reported over 100 times and only once I actually got banned).
",0
"This is very tedious, therefore, ROBLOX most likely cannot get to each and every report, which leads to many people thinking that the report system does not work.
",1
"The best solution for this is just to exit the game.
",4
"I know I said a lot, and most of you probably won't agree with a 14 year old who is inexperienced with life in general, but that's just my opinion.
",4
"The world is the world, so expect some violent behavior and swearing.
",3
"There are also games like Innovation Lab where you can experience a meltdown, mess with the core and drop it's temperature down to the negatives, and ""study"" alien lifeforms.
",9
"Now to the bad things.
",1
"Their updates have gotten really bad over the years, and nobody seems to like them.
",1
"It gives avatars a realistic look, but NOT in a good way.
",3
"More than a third of Roblox users don't want it to be added.
",5
"Players have seem to find ways to get around the Roblox moderation system and curse.
",1
"Safety is also a problem.
",8
"The player should know better to NOT give out their address, age, or even their name, but up to today, they've found a way to do so.
",7
"Security settings seem to help most targeted accounts of a hacker, but I've already gotten hacked WITH COMPLETE security on it.
",6
"I've tried anything I can to get them out of my account, and I'm pretty sure I got hacked by a keylogger.
",0
"I do think that the currency ""robux"" is a bit overrated.
",2
"The other bad side to ROBLOX is, is that there is too much bad stuff on it.
",2
"If I were you, be careful which games you play because sometimes 18+ games are made and released to the public for 2,3 maybe even a week before found and taken down.
",8
"These kind of games have bad things in it and don't have a filter.
",1
"When it at its released, Its not that popular so there is only a few O'ders and bully.
",3
"That means there are now alot of O'ders and bully.
",8
"Also the removal of tickets makes player scammed players easier, mostly NBC users.
",8
"Also the moderation is trash, reports always ignored.

"You cannot swear in this game because of hashtags and you cannot say numbers.

"First there are to many young children on roblox for the games that roblox has such as roblox highschool (where there are countless amount of children not even old enough to be in highschool, ""dating"" and doing other innapropriate things in that game and other roblox roleplaying games) also there is Phantom Forces, Murder Mystery, Jailbreak and countless other games with weapons, and effects that aren't good for children under 13 yet a large majority of players are under 13 .
",1
"The chat has horrible censorship where words that are simple get censored, and many people get away with horrendously innapropriate roblox usernames, as a free player your choices for changing your character is low and appaling, and it's sad the little creativity the roblox staff put into free character customization, and item collection, also there are ridiculous prices on these items where even if you decided to spend $10 to buy some robux you still wouldn't be able to buy much, and also many games have i

"Also there are clickbait titles, and misleading thumbnails over many roblox games, and since these kids are easily persuaded to join these various games that are innapropriate or just not good for the roblox communitys growth and betterment, honestly there are various games that are good and honestly well made but again due to the large amount of children playing this game (without parent supervision as well) these kids spew horrendous words, and misuse and abuse the game system, and because there young, an

"1st of all roblox isnt changing your kid age is.

"If you dont know it was about 3rd grade in which kids started cursing for me.

"Also in roblox they do tag curse words now.

"They tag almost the whole dictonary.

"Now bullying?

"Bullying isn't too too common.
",2
"If you are worried about teens being inappropriate around your little kids don't worry so bad.
",7
"There are so many online bullies there that humiliated me.
",9
"And I thought that reporting would work but guess what  the roblox moderators dont give  a  sh*t. They do not read the ban reports at ALL.
",2
"Andbthere is this sh*tty thing on roblox called safechat and it doesnt let ANYONE say anything, well I might be,exaggerating here but you can say some words but you cannot say the following quoted lines: ""so what does the play button say?""
",7
"""dude stop teabagging me!""
",5
"""I hate roblox!""
",2
"All of these lines are totally appropriate in real life and in other games but safechat makes sure that you are pissed off.
",8
"Last but not least the community, It is so bad.
",6
"And it is so trashy, here is an example.
",2
"They will most likely say no or say eww a noob or walk away or leave the game.

"So remember, Roblox is not fun at ALL.

"But for kids, definitely no.

"My friend's child is deeply addicted to the game and always throws fits when we tell her to stop playing.

"It came to the point where now, she has bad grades and is going a bit overweight.

"And also don't trust those free robux sites!!

"Roblox is my favorite game, but there are countless scams and hacks on roblox.
",2
"The most common scam is ""free robux"" which I have played many of.

"The thing is, only about a third of them are actual scams, while others either lead to scams, cost robux, or just do not work.

"Trust me, I have played many of these games and they are all fake.

"Unbelieveably, there are youtube vids of how too HACK a ROBLOX ACCOUNT or how to get FREE OBC (outrageous builder's club), which is leading to absolute chaos in the roblox community.

"I have played it for a long time, (I only played good, age-appropriate games) but my parents banned it.

"Your child has a 99% chance of encountering something bad.

"Unfortunately, all games that have multiple players have risks.

"If you are going to let your child play this game, you need to be involved constantly.

"This game is better left untried.

"Bad words are not accepted in the chat.
",3
"The game can be used violently with the weapons that can be used, and admin abuse has now begun.

"This game can allow dating, cursing/swearing by using chat in a weird way, and also things that can be used for sex, money, lying about information, and you can give private information in a way.

"roblox a game were there are online daters, trollers, scams and hackers i've been a veteran for about 2 years now and i've noticed all of these things roblox does not care about online daters because they buy robux and that - money do not try this game online daters have sexual stuff on this website..
",6
"Pretty okay i guess, But some games on roblox have pretty toxic communities, So i advise you to disable chat for your child's account.
",5
"Also if you think this game has too much violence, you really are tripping, there's a fighting genre on roblox for a reason.
",3
"There are chat filters which censor out profanity and inappropriate text which is quite hard to bypass.
",1
"There are many children which play this game so there are occasionally some predators, but you have the option to report and block other users if they are harassing you.

"Some games are a bit violent and can include death, but it is quite comical since the character makes an ""oof"" noise when dying and has his/her blocky limbs fall off.

"
",0
"On rare occasions, literal games who pop up on the popular games are trying to scam ya, no...
",8
"The hashtags is too harsh and it literally tags out simple things like Coke, Phone, 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.
",1
"on Clubs, people like girls decide to wear horny and slutty outfits with man legs or original legs to make them thicc, like literally, what the fuck...

"All the clickbait games can give you down right crying cause of you not seeing something on the thumbnail after 10 minutes...

"Breast Shading, Bras, Sexy fishnets, etc....

"My family would avoid all of those things and it would be perfectly fine, expect the other unlucky kids who get viruses on their iPads and Computers which is obviously a fucking weird coincidence which i don't believe, how can iPads or iPhones get viruses from a literal App Store game or Google Play Store game.. ._.

"-------------THE DARK SIDE OF ROBLOX-------------
",0
"Sadly, many Roblox players break terms of service.
",1
"They are known as Online Daters.
",8
"These people date on Roblox and even have sex there.
",8
"Some even make Roblox sex games.
",1
"Roblox also removed tix just so they could make more money, because without tix, you have to pay for everything.
",6
"This lead to an increase in bullies.
",8
"The bullies called the people who don't have robux ""Noobs"" when in reality, noobs are new players.
",4
"Another thing to avoid is ""Free Robux"" games.
",7
"They do not give robux and are only made to steal your account.
",5
"DO NOT enter your password and leave the game immediately.
",5
"If you enter your password, your account will be stolen.
",5
"Trust me, my account got stolen once and it took me a while to get it back.
",0
"Roblox is a game with very much swearing, bullying, and 2/5 of the players are very much Online Dating.
",2
"There might be much violence but kids 13- can enable restricted games.
",3
"It is impossible to report and having an admin or a moderator to review it, even if it says so.
",5
"This means that players can easily bully people.
",4
"Also a good part of games are violent.
",2
"For example, if you are playing a zombie shooter game, you would most likely see someone cursing or using some kind of inapproiate language instead of playing a disney princess game, you are less likely to hear inapporpraite language.
",7
"However, if your child does not feel comfortable on Roblox due to a situation they may send a report that goes to the Roblox developers and take care of the issue.
",4
"The reporting system is effective but it does take quite a while for Roblox to take care of the issue but they get it done.Roblox has sexual content, some inappropraite language, and alot of consumerism.
",2
"Roblox in my opinion does have too much consumerism because everything you have to buy!!
",8
"That is outrageous!
",2
"There are constant ads on how you should buy this and that, so it does get a bit annoying.
",6
"Too much violence
",2
"There's a safe chat so 6 year olds probably won't understand that.
",4
"Anyone could play this game, but not every little kid could understand it.

"It may have slight bad words and bad stuff, however most is blocked by their system.

",7
"the users can talk about anything as it is poorly moderated.

"The moderation is the main problem of this site, it is very poor as there are very few things done with moderation since there are so few moderators and over millions of users, they probably should have come up with  with a game plan  but seemingly, the population of Roblox has exploded, probably shocking what few moderators there are to this site.. Now, let's go onto the community, which is sort of chaotic, if your child is under 10 years of age, i suggest you watch over  them when they do play Roblox, if

"These people that do not like OD'ers try to stop them and try to get them to see the danger, others pester them out of doing it, since there is little moderation, the community is trying, (And not really doing well since 70% of the Roblox community age average is around 11 years old.)
",9
"to fill in the spot where the moderation is, however, the people in  this game can get angered easily, arguments are quite common, though, cursing is not directly possible unless using exploitation methods (Bypassing the chat filter FULLY.)
",1
"People try to bypass the filter by instead of saying, let's say, the f- word, they'll probably say, ""f**** you, you b****,"" and many other things that children under 14 probably should not be hearing, they may even go as far as just removing one letter, then replacing it with a number.

"Well ROBLOX may be a fun gaame but it is filled up with cyber bullyies and other bad stuff , when i was playing ROBLOX in the game ""MeepCity"" i saw A LOTS OF PLAYERS ONLINE DATING and a guy made his house like  A STRIP CLUB YES YOU READ CORRECTLY SO I THINK THAT ROBLOX IS NOT THAT MUCH KID FRIENDLY .... because of this i quitted roblox.

"Roblox tries to hashtag what people say, but you can just space or add extra letters to skip hashtags and cheat the system.

"I've notice it isn't a very safe game for a younger group of kids since you could give out personal information.

"It just means is blocks something's you say.
",1
"Those blockheads... and there are lots of bad messages.
",8
"The community is bad too.
",2
"Well there is no swearing when you swear it comes up hashtag.nothing else bad except privacy and freedom concerns.

"The only thing is, when you chat in games, people swear a lot, so I would keep young kids away from it.

"I don't know what the fuss about the support department is because i set a pin on my account to prevent people changing my password but i forgot it, so i emailed info@roblox.com (the support email) and within less than a day i had a reply and it had been disabled from my account so i could access my settings again.

"Most roleplay games are the games that have online dating and non child friendly stuff so stay away from that if you can.
",8
"The biggest issue i have come across are exploiters (aka ""hackers"") if you want to avoid this a good way to do so is don't join games with small amounts of players in because  most of the time unpopular games are the ones that get exploited the most.
",8
"There are violent games, to name one, ""Phantom Forces"", but that's not the only one.
",3
"The main problem is the PARENTS not having enough of an eye on what their child is doing, which would be SO GOOD if it happened, because then they can put a stop to whatever bad things are happening.

"All of those ""predators"" online are usually just preteen Online Daters looking to have a virtual relationship because they can't get a real grill.

"Hacking is rampant, however, but it won't happen to you.

"Because it's on a roleplaying game, the kids think it's just a 'roleplay' and the pedophile is just playing....what's actually happening is the pedophiles are corrupting the kids mind.

"It censors swear words and personal info.

",6
"Keep your little kids off of roblox you shitty morons I don't wanna play with anymore 8 year old noobs

"And inappropriate games made by random people.

"What i think about this game well don't get offend, Is worse game ever not being rude, that in my opinion why is worse?

"We have mostly online daters admin not doing their job, sexual content, Way to much violence.

"The game is a child's game with some games that have violence and horror.

"The admins are awful and the system cannot do jack to detect altered curse words, the report system never works which is great (in a way) because it can teach your kids to suck it up and move on.
",2
"BUT there is some people who bypass any censorship and post nudity in certain games but those games barely get any attention.
",1
"Your account cannot be deleted as one parent said they could but they mixed it up with builders club.

"Builders club is a service in which you pay roblox REAL money for online currency, this system is awful and should not be used.
",6
"DON'T be an idiot and mix things up with this game, just because it's online doesn't mean it's bad.
",7
"Most of the games are kid-friendly, but unfortunately one or two players don't know how to behave appropriately and some areas on ROBLOX are prone to hackers and predators.
",7
"The reporting system is not the best, but chat moderations are set to a good age.
",1
"However, in execution ROBLOX goes downhill.
",3
"It's taken an extremly commercial approach to things as of latley, and if you get a child hooked up to play this, I will guarantee they will come to you begging for money to buy the game's in-game currency, ROBUX.

"The playerbase has become notoriously filled with jerks and trolls, though they can't do much do to the game's limiting filter.

"Fun, but mini games can be bad.

"so ive been on roblox for almost a year now and i've seen people posting swear words and having sex and ODing (aka online dating)  the moderators ban you for very stupid reasons i once got banned for posting a mcdonalds ad and apparently from the moderators point of view it was ""inappropriate""  the reporting system doesn't work and it's useless .

"Remember, stay away from the violent games kids.

"That's just...eww.
",0
"Also, watch out for clickbait; they try to give their creators Robux by luring you in with false titles like ""ONLY GIRLS CAN PLAY"" and usually have bad ratings, switching (and all-caps) titles, bad quality thumbnails, the false ""This game is made by me and all other games are copies"" statement, and as everyone knows, sometimes thumbnails from Roblox YOUTUBE videos.

"This game used to be fun and I played it for a while but this game is now FULL of scammers and YouTubers and people of the ROBLOX community share this around and If your child finds a website link that says you could get free currency in the game then you're at risk of the entire account and personal information.

"Unfortunately, there- as in all online games, can be people who are actually pedophiles targeting children.
",4
"I've played ROBLOX for 2 years and I can promise that there is definitely some strange stuff going on with this game.

"That gives of a very bad image to kids, and it should not be reflected to ROBLOX's main audience, which is younger children.

"It's also very obvious ROBLOX is finding ways to get the parents' money out of overpriced game currency and toys.
",6
"The graphics are bad, many salty players who uses profanity extremely often.
",1
"I think parents should know that the only reason why bad stuff happens is because  your kid might have OD/online dated or said stuff that should have been kept to their self.
",7
"the game does have hashtags so if there is a bad word or something your kid won't be able to read it,also there might be other bad stuff in roblox but kids should know not to search a game the would be bad.
",7
"There is a ""Report Abuse"" button that will most likely get the game or player removed.
",1
"Roblox does have a chat filter, meaning ""F**k, S**t, B***h"" and so on, will be turned into Hashtags (Example: ""Player: This game is ####!"")
",1
"Roblox is now more than chatting but a weapon to human trafficking and predatorism.Users in Roblox usually Online Date(OD) With each other without getting close in personal.This is also dangerous because those users are possibly child predators.Frauds are even spammed on the games' comment leading to scam popularity.Roblox is also encouraging users to buy their Robux as their own currency exchange to US Dollar system to change their looks leading roblox as the worst money economy trust when it comes to welf
",8
"First of all, I would just like to say how much I passionately hate this website.
",8
"The reviews are all written by people who have the same parenting skills as overprotective, stereotypical ""soccer moms"" that about everyone in this generation can't stand.
",9
"But I guess we'll just have to deal with that.
",5
"Second, I would like to say how the reviews of this game are wrong.
",2
"There's a 12+ mode, for God's sake!
",6
"If your child wants to get this game because all of the other 6 year olds at his or her school have it, put on the dang filter!
",0
"Finally, this game sucks.
",0
"Obviously, your child won't listen to any reason most likely about quality, but this game is literally filled to the brim with the most annoying people and *shocker* there are ""bad people"" on it!
",3
"I'm sure you'll find someone who wants to stalk your child or something.
",7
"And yes, there is very little moderation.
",2
"But that doesn't matter compared to how bad this game is in general.
",9
"Apart from a couple of good servers here and there, it's all ""fidget spinner obstacle course"" and crap.
",6
"If you're a parent and you actually read all of this, I hope you learned something.
",7
"That intention was completely pure, but the problem was they made it a community run game and eventually added to many things that cost ingame currency.
",6
"The game's community became infested with people trying to get ""Robux"" and sexual content.
",9
"Kids are being exposed to things they shouldn't be.

"This games filters are also trash and their moderation is even worse.

"They have something called ""reporting"" which doesn't work at all.

"There are many things wrong with this game.
",2
"The roblox admins are money hungry idiots
",2
"The roblox admins are so money hungry they go against there own rule (which is a very serious one).It is called online dating.

"This is bad because there are child predators that target children and date them.

"The roblox admins do not care to enrforce this rule.
",9
"Not banning the right people.
",9
"Just like I said on reason one roblox dosent enforce their rules, and online daters that have done very pornographic stuff have not been banned yet.
",2
"Instead roblox bans randomly innocent players for no reason.
",2
"Well the reason for this is that roblox BANS anybody who crticizes the online daters.
",3
"That's just really weird and odd.
",8
"3.Annoying scammers and bots
",8
"Im sure everyone on roblox has seen bots.
",2
"They lure you into these stupid sites promising free robux.

"Scammers are also common.
",8
"Most parents come here and give their opinion that this game has inappropriate games, bad chat filters and terrible players.

"Most of these games have mild violent content.

"It's not like blood spews out everywhere and you could see the player's shot limbs come apart and things like that.

"I have gone on empty games to check the chat filters, and there is almost no way to do so.

"Unless you use the word 'Sheet' as a substitute, there is no other way to do so.
",1
"And if you focus where the terrible players are, you will miss the chance to find good, supportive and helpful ones.
",6
"And as for the terrible players, just tell your child to stiffen up and learn not to take these comments seriously, and to laugh them off.
",7
"Im not saying to make them soft, but make them realize that this is the INTERNET, where MOST of the people can insult others, because they will never meet them in real life, and if they do, they wont know that one guy that they told to KYS.

"even the smallest details like a phone number, PO box or email should not be revealed.

"I immediately regretted this decision and I had the sudden urge to throw myself off Mount Everest.
",0
"Yeah, it was that bad, and let me explain why:
",0
"
",0
"The controls are a nightmare, movement is awkward, camera controls belong to the Nintendo 64 (a comparison to how outdated these controls are), and the animations are stiff and poorly designed.
",1
"Mini games vary in quality, as the creators can have inappropriate concepts within the game (from sex, to swearing, to drinking, to bad influences, etc.).
",1
"Despite my comments from the previous section (and despite what FamilyZone has to say about this game, link to their review: https://www.familyzone.com/blog/roblox-parents-review), there are more dangerous games out there.
",5
"If this came out prior to Night Trap (the game that created the ESRB ratings in 1992), I would doubt that this game would cause outrage and force a rating system that would keep dangerous games away from children.
",4
"There are other games with more violence and explicit content than Roblox (which is, by the way, its only redeemable quality).
",1
"One problem I had when making this review was what age group should be playing this game.
",0
"Recently, I've noticed a lot of children on games they shouldn't have.
",9
"Parents ought to be more careful when a game has voice chat or any form of in-game chat, as I have received rude messages, death threats, sexually explicit phrases, etc.
",9
"Overall, I believe that Roblox is the poor man's Minecraft.
",9
"Although it is online, your just dealing with 3 year old wannabes who are salty.
",5
"I'd stay away from Roleplay, it goes from silly to graphic (not blood wise).
",8
"You get a ton of spam from bots, but those are just phising for accounts, delete any spam before your kid wants robux for free.
",7
"If your child would rather play games on roblox, some games are child friendly, (without violence, horror, mature themes) but there are some games that contain weapons, and there are some pretty creepy horror games.
",3
"If your child gets asked to be their boyfriend or girlfriend by another player, report the user and leave the game.
",7
"But sadly, you cannot control who sends you friend requests.
",7
"The last think I think families MUST BE AWARE OF on roblox is scamming.
",2
"There are spam accounts on roblox made to spread the word of third party websites that look like roblox websites.
",5
"The rest are scams trying to steal personal info.
",8
"But there are many dangers and your children should be aware of these dangers before playing.
",8
"For those of you parents who are new to ""ROBLOX"" I have seen some of the worst possible material shown to children of only 9 years of age.
",2
"From Neo-Nazi groups to Sexual imagery, this game is not something I would recommend for children.
",3
"If you want a safe child-friendly game don't even look for one, the only ones avaible are the types that make your child a real punk online.
",5
"DO NOT ALLOW YOUR CHILD TO PLAY ROBLOX UNTIL THEY'RE 14+ UNLESS YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE EARLY EXPOSURE TO SEXUAL CONTENT, NEO-NAZISM, ONLINE DATING, SEX ED, THEFT/INAPPROPIATE BLOOD SPLATTER, SUICIDE, ANTI-SEMITISM AND MANY  MORE INAPPROPIATE SUBJECTS INCLUDING ADDICTION!

"(swearing in minor cases) also Builders Club is made to be an addiction, don't even buy it for your kid once stay safe.
",6
"The bad things are the violence and skimpy outfits.
",4
"Also you can stalk people and break into there houses.
",2
"Child Predators lurk around every corner, constant pressure to buy builders club to be ""trendy"" and not a ""noob,"" tons of cyberbullying.
",6
"Please do NOT let your children on this.
",7
"It is NOT educational.
",2
"The games are brain dead, and there is no moderation from admins.
",2
"Overall roblox is pretty fun and safe,  but the report system doesn't work, the safechat is easily bypassed.
",1
"Also the moderators and administration care more about money than child safety and allow ODers (Online Daters) these people search for boyfriends and girlfriends in game and as you understand they might be pedophiles.
",1
"Groups that attempt to stop ODers are targeted by the administration and often banned for what they didn't do.

"Brief summary: careless administration, exploiters, report button doesn't work, safechat can easily be bypassed.

",0
"Oh, and the fact that this fat guy obby was basically vore, i can't stand it.
",0
"This game isn't appropriate for little kids at ALL.
",4
"Some problems with roblox are the fact that you can bypass swearing, trashy moderation, and consumer overload.
",5
"I have probably spent around 200 dollars in robux alone and that is a problem.

"The robux money system is not something you can earn with a NBC (Non-BuildersClub) Account.

",2
"I am on that +13 mark now and I shouldnt have numbers and common names hashtagged.
",6
"I understand that they want to keep parents on their side but for the older players it just flat out sucks.
",6
"Well, to start, this game has false advertisements.
",2
"The creators of this game are greedy people an I will tell you how: they have an in-game currency that can only be obtained by spending at least $4.
",6
"What's wrong with that?""
",5
"Well you have a cool avatar to not get cyberbullied and the creatord make the avatar clothing so expensive in ROBUX (that currency) that they make your child beg you to buy ROBUX.
",5
"Also, that website is NOT safe because there are ""ROBUX scammers"" who try to steal your child's account and steal their ROBUX that you paid for.
",5
"There are user-created games that involve violence, drugs, smoking, sex, etc.
",8
"The creators do nothing to help the game and they do rarely ban hackers.
",6
"There are so many hackers that hack both the games and your child's account.

"Kids will be more violent and disgusting (as in talking about sex) after playing ROBLOX for at least a week.
",0
"Keep your child away from this game at all times.
",7
"The creators try and make the ads good but not the actual game.
",2
"Most of the reviews are coming from fake parents or ignorant idiots who think trash.
",2
"Games with ""have a family"" and stuff is where most pedos or online daters are at.
",2
"Games like JailBreak, Restaurant tycoon and some popular games that have no intention or idea of having a family or baby are anti-oder free.
",3
"It's the parents fault for allowing the kids to play the restricted online dating games and there is a rare chance of actually confronting a hacker or exploiter.
",6
"Some of them hack those family or have a baby game because they hate them!
",2
"I Play Roblox everyday, and it just gets worse and worse.
",6
"People are rude to others for no reason.

"The Creators are stupid and just want money, there is only 6 ways to get robux.

"It is just turning horrible.

"Roblox uses stupid trends like fidget spinners.

"This game makes kids addicted to money and they all would do anything to grab some robux.

"Roblox is the most clickbaited game ever other than GTA.

"If you are a parent and your child is under 9, Dont let your kid play the game.

"If you ignore this, in about 6 months, You will regret even letting ur child play.

"But as I said a while ago it got removed, and now people aren't able to buy anything in the catalog unless its free, which rarely occurs and most people who wear these free items often get called noobs, which was a commonly used word back in 2014 and such, but now it's kind of rare.
",9
"But speaking of people getting bullied while wearing these free clothes, people bypass the filter and use swear words on kids instead.
",1
"It hasn't been changed, and mostly removes words that are completely fine.
",8
"Also as I was speaking about the currencies before, Robux is a premium currency, meaning you can only get it by spending real money on this piece of garbage of a game.
",6
"Most likely you'll be charged before you even know it, as to cancel your subscription you'll have to go to your account's settings, where almost no one goes..
",7
"ROBLOX is really a boring and unsatisfying game that lets users create their own games, which most of the time are rip-offs other games and something like 'Escape the evil overlord obby.'
",9
"The players of ROBLOX are mostly threats to children, asking them to online date, giving them links to scams, even some swear words aren't censored in the chat.
",1
"Not only that, but ROBLOX is a home to thousands of hackers, who hack into games to give themselves cheats or exploits.
",6
"There is one hack where two players are forced to... rape each other, and a dick and breasts will be placed onto the players when they are forced into doing it.
",1
"A lot of the games on ROBLOX have violence such as guns, swords and other weapons, and some even contain real blood.
",3
"When you first join, your avatar is what other players call a 'noob' and because of that, many people will hate you, annoy you and make you plain out angry, but it could force a child could cry because of being cyber bullied.
",7
"The people behind the idea of ROBLOX are greedy.
",2
"A while ago there was something called TIX, which was the alternate version of the in-game money ROBUX, until the creators removed it, forcing all players to waste money on virtual cash.
",0
"The game is plain out inappropiate, boring, and threatening to all kids of any age.
",6
"all you idiots dont know how to deal with flamewar starters
",0
"Yes some games contain blood gore and stuff like that, just don't play those games.
",3
"Ive never found any people swearing in there either.
",1
"While there are a couple people swearing here and there, you can block them, report them, turn off the chat, or exit the game.
",1
"The real problem is not preparing your child for what's coming, and you as parent's are the only ones who can do that.
",2
"The only thing bad about this game are people, and if your child can handle people, then they are good to go.
",7
"The moderators on this game take way too long to do anything and ignore all the under age online dating, players can seduce kids into meeting them, and it is a huge risk for anyone below 18, people bypass filters saying expletive cuss words.
",1
"A long time ago it had more potential now its just a site for vulgar and very disgusting things to occur on i wouldn't recommend this to any parent or child.
",0
"But the parent reviews are full of, "" MY LITTLE BILLY GOT TRACKED DOWN BY A PREDATOR AND CAME INTO MY HOUSE... ROBLOX IS UNSAFE!! ""
",2
"Look, it's not ROBLOX that's the problem.
",4
"You should atleast watch your kid on his Ipad, instead of bragging to karen about how little jimmy has straight a's wa'll some old guy asks him for photo's of his penis.
",7
"Instead of letting some guy come into your house, maybe you should actually PARENT YOUR CHILDREN.
",7
"The ROBLOX staff can't control how the users behave.
",4
"Many websites have this behaviour.
",5
"YouTube has inappropriate videos and rude users, but many kids use it!
",1
"And, what I find most disturbing is that kids or players on games like to stare at these disturbing decals.
",8
"Going back to exploiters they can basically do whatever they want even get passes filtering enabled which is a mode to prevent exploiters these exploiters often like to troll as they can simply type in a script and it will be given to them such as sucuide bombs or guns that if you shoot them at a player blood and gore will come out to weapons or rides that ruin the experience on roblox due to the fact they are cheating to godding them selves (Such as making them to no one can defeat there character) To ruin
",3
"I however DONT like how the main currency in this game, Robux is not earned, however bought...
",6
"I think this is sending the wrong message about money to kids.
",5
"I also think that is is very hard to get bullied and be attacked/targeted on here.
",8
"If you try to say something inappropriate or mean, it will come out in tags.
",1
"Parents can also change security options... so it makes it even harder to message people or receive messages.
",5
"Spam is another issue but... if you educate your kids to not click these, they should know not to.
",7
"There is no such thing as FREE ROBUX.
",1
"A lot of people say it's bad for kids, but don't listen to them.
",2
"Don't recommend.
",0
"I gave in my details, and then, my account got compromised and I had to make a new one.
",0
"The cons I have about this game are the amount of child predators/pedophiles there are in the game, and how some games might be violent in ROBLOX.
",3
"(Especially when the mention MeepCity, a game known for being social on ROBLOX, but can have tons of pedophiles without you ever knowing.)
",4
"Roblox is a great game and anyone who thinks its ""awful"" know this, roblox pays millions of dollars to young people and your getting mad and attacking roblox just becuase its ""not safe for children"" suriesly sit down and acualy explore the site.
",9
"Just dont say whatever the media says becuase they are just trying to get clicks on there articles.
",5
"Keep in mind though, that their are clickbait and role play games, which can have a lot of online daters and child predators.
",1
"I advice that you stay away from those games.
",7
"You shouldn't exactly listen to every single story of a parent saying that Roblox is filled with inappropriate things or sexual things, because they actually do not understand what is really going on.
",2
"If you fear that your child is not safe when playing Roblox, you can go into the account's settings in the top right corner of the website and edit your child's account so they cannot either chat with people in-game or on the website.
",5
"The only games that I consider inappropriate on Roblox is the ""Adopt a Kid"", ""Have a Family RP"", ""Adopt a Baby"", etc.
",3
"Those games do have players who tend to dress inappropriately and act dirty or Online Date (also called ODing or OD'ers), and some other times players are just ""role-playing"" and are just pretending to be a baby or a adult and pretending to have a family.
",8
"Also, if you have a sensitive child, you're going to have to watch out for what games your child plays, as some games do have bullies, not many but some.
",7
"Often, bullies will make fun of your child for being ""poor"" since they don't have ROBUX.
",7
"Bullies also try to swear but the word gets filtered but they try to get around the censors.
",1
"Bullies will make fun of your child by calling them a ""noob"" (new player but often used as an insult for terrible players) or autistic just to be mean or because they didn't get their way.
",4
"Mostly, the High School, Adopt and Raise a Baby, and Shooting type games will have the most inappropriate things and bullies.
",1
"If you're worried about violence, just don't have your child play Prison related games like ""Prison Life"" and ""Jailbreak"" or Shooting games like ""Phantom Forces"" (a call of duty type game).
",4
"Violence often depends on the specific game your child is playing.
",3
"Police Officers are supposed to catch the Criminals and bring them back to jail.
",0
"Also, you shouldn't have to worry about a ""naked"" player.
",7
"If your child is being bullied, you need to have them (or you can do it yourself) report the bully.
",7
"But, if your child false reports something (like reporting because he/she didnt have his/her way or losed to another player and got angry) will get them banned.
",6
"But, alot of games don't allow gears so its best to not buy alot of gears.
",3
"But, there are scammers that are clever and sneaky.
",8
"Those are websites that will either steal your child's account or give you a Virus.
",5
"A new recent scam is friend requests from, ""ClickMe_(random numbers and letters)"", ""DontClickMe_(random numbers and letters)"", ""MinionsProfile_(random numbers and letters), etc.
",1
"Always tell your child to NEVER, EVER, give their location, name, or age, because it is dangerous and something bad could happen.
",7
"It's best to not let kids under 10 play Roblox, since they're still new to the Internet and the dangers of the Internet.
",5
"I am just a teen, but even I can see that this site is poorly moderated and the content is inappropriate.
",1
"This game allows children 5+ to play violent games like Murder Mystery, where you have to throw knives, shoot and find out who is murdering everyone.
",0
"This game is also a target point for child predators.
",4
"The chat is barely moderated and I have many friends who have been scammed and threatened by the children and/or predators on this site.
",1
"Its community has been a jerk to me.
",5
"I quit this game forever.
",0
"There is some violence but I think a 7 year old can handle it properly.
",2
"Yes, a lot of the popular games have violence, but im sure your kid already knows all of the violent stuff in these games, and if you dont want your kid playing these games, there is a plethora of games that aren't violent AT ALL.
",7
"A lot of the reviews which say like 13+ or something like that took a quick look at ROBLOX, then developed an opinion based off of things that happened 5 years ago ( bad chat filtering, and a few bad games that managed to poke through moderators and get to the front page).
",1
"I would say that the major flaw this game has is consumerism.
",9
"A lot of the ""cool"" looking items in ROBLOX cost a lot of ROBUX, which you can only get by buying them or buying one of three types of Builders Club that costs money.
",9
"I've seen many reviews on this site complaining that the games are not for children  at all due to the players,  and honestly,  that's the only problem with ROBLOX.
",2
"The games are made by the community,  and most of those games are absolutely fantastic,  but it cannot be avoided that there will be several disgusting people that want to ruin the entire game.
",3
"I've also went through several exploits while playing the game and most of them have included sexual images,  but as long as your child does not encounter any of these then they're fine.
",1
"And violent games should also be considered.
",3
"Although the censorship (Roblox uses a broken filter called ""Community Sift"") can be easily bypassed and there are lots of scammers, exploiters, cheaters, hackers, rule-breakers, etc.
",1
"This game does have cartoon violence.It's good for a teen game, but kids can get their account hacked easily if they don't fall for these scams.
",3
"All forums in Roblox are moderated in Roblox, but ""Suggestions & Ideas"" has lousy moderation in my opinion, and hardly any mods check that sub-forum.
",1
"The forums DO get spammed or off topic sometimes.
",9
"Maps can be violent including guns and other weapons.
",3
"Their is a player chat which can be dangerous.
",1
"Parents complain about it being ""sexual"" & ""violent"", they say that the game is poorly moderated.
",1
"It's not, parents insult roblox with these sayings.
",4
"ROBLOX, of course has flaws, some people find ways to have certain 18+ scenarios.
",1
"But ROBLOX gets to it quick, they ban the creator.
",6
"By tagging system yes it is a little overrated.
",2
"Violence, well this game warns you of violence.
",5
"Check the ROBLOX app it says 12+ for violence, guns, knifes.
",5
"So yeah, violence is Implied with it.
",3
"Yes, people are bullied but I happens everywhere in every game.
",2
"If you don't want your child annoyed or harassed just don't put them on the game.
",7
"If you don't moderate your child's game, that's terrible parenting then.
",5
"So instead of insulting a child's game I think you should take care of it for yourself.
",4
"My 14 year old and my 4 year old play this and i sit there watching them and the game is harmless they play and all they do when someone dies is they fall into 5 or 6 pieces on the ground, HARMLESS!!!!!!

"STOP BEING MEAN

"I seen reviews of ''hacking'', ''porn'', etc.

"If your child seen porn in game, that server was probably exploited.

"Always join a game that it's hard to exploit.

"If it's not exploits, some trolls were probably trying to make it seen like your child was watching porn by having two people be naked (Actually, Roblox doesn't allow people to be naked anymore in this new update.

"There could be exploits that can let you swear but Roblox always patches exploits.
",1
"That'll be called a stalker.

"There shouldn't be a problem with stalking, online dating, cyberbullying, or anything that involves with messaging.

"On the other hand, you still might have problems with exploiters, trolls, or anything that doesn't involve messaging.

"No normal player wants to deal with restrictions such as the default clothing when you make your character naked, they like using body colors such as the famous classic noob body colors.

"Or the safechat that always censors things that doesn't need to be censored such as single letters or numbers that doesn't look like phone numbers, home address, etc.

"they immediately complain saying that ""reports do stuff"" and brag on about how they  know so much about Roblox and that I should learn more about roblox.

"Then the first time you play a game that is not completely unfair, and you win, THE WHOLE SERVER CALLS YOU A HACKER.

"A lot of users on Roblox cyberbully others for not having  enough of the game currency, Robux, to buy clothes.

"Ever since the other currency,  Tix, was removed, other users have never been able to get a larger variety with clothes without using real life money.

"Everything will be hacked in one point of time.

"Some games allow cursing as moderators try replacing bad words or personal info with hashtags (#).

"but kids can figure out the words so overall not that positive in messages although there are some nice players... Also the players can ask to be boyfriends and girlfriends by simply saying boyf and girlf and it can turn really personal with conversations which moderators are trying to avoid.

"This is the reason this game isin't very safe for anyone under the age i put (or atleast what age i think of).

"They'll curse at you, troll you, try to make the game generally unfun, and the (probably) main problem is when some teen/adult starts talking about explicit material.

"And most of this game is for kids too, so it's not exactly good to have your kid see material like that.

"Now, to be fair, the game itself doesn't get a rating, because there is literally no game, unless the community makes something out of it.
",6
"The community rating, however, is just too toxic for me, or any kid under my age to play.

"Going off of phantom forces, perhaps the reason it's so popular, is because there is no chance, no point, and no place you could really make a bad scenario.

"And don't even get me started on how much useless cosmetics cost in this game.

"I honestly wouldn't suggest your child playing this if he/she is addictive and if they become desperate for Robux (in-game currency).

"Also, there are a lot of YouTubers out there that prove the games immaturity by them raising their voices and acting all exaggerated.

"What is appalling is how they try to convince the younger audience to hack their game in order to ""fit in for free"".

"This is just one of the flaws Roblox has to experience with it being more of a ""freemium game"" then free.

"seems like roblox doesn't care because my brother got his account stolen by some mexican dude scamming him from robux.
",0
"the scammer said, trust me bro, i'll just give you the robux, my bro didn't trust him until the scammer talked to him with respect.
",0
"man he was in tears when he found out his account was stolen.
",0
"then roblox sent me links which wasn't helpful at off.
",6
"add a phone number roblox so it will be easier to communicate to you roblox as far as billing, account,emails,passwords.also i play roblox and i don't like the game right now cause of hackers, sexual people, scammers, and trollers.
",5
"it is very annoying and i think you should fix your service and step up more on your security.
",7
"also once when my bro was trying to buy robux, he got robbed by them when he paid 10 bucks but didn't get his robux.
",0
"It's like they will reply for money, but they won't really help you that much as far as helping you with your accounts, billing....all they want is your money(even though the app its self is free).
",3
"Roblox......I am not going to give you a 5 star rating right now unless you step up your service and helping those people that are getting cyber bullied.
",7
"im very dissappointed and i recremmond letting your child play for only an hour or so instead of the whole intire day.
",3
"FIX THIS ROBLOX
",0
"A horrible rip off of Minecraft.
",0
"Some games have violence, like a game called Murder Mystery.
",3
"There is swearing.
",2
"You can not use symbols in your password.
",1
"Unkind people; cyberbullies.
",0
"Well without that safe password you will be hacked!
",5
"The chat filter is blocking almost any word you know!
",1
"Low quality, wastes your battery, and not safe and secure.
",5
"Well once I was playing a game on here and had to report three (3) rude people.
",0
"Roblox is a pay-to-win game.
",2
"A problem with this is that you have to pay money actually sell these things, which makes no sense.
",6
"The game itself is very ugly and glitchy.
",3
"Another problem is that since you have to pay to win, many hackers try to hack the game.
",8
"Another problem is that accounts don't require emails and cannot be deleted.
",9
"Another problem is it's content.
",2
"Also violence is common, although no blood is in the game.
",1
"The Roblox company itself is a very bad company that puts money first instead of its players.
",9
"What parents should do is block the game entirely.
",7
"It is an entire scam that acts like it's not.
",1
"Parents should instead teach their kids an instrument or buy them nerf guns, anything but this.
",7
"But there are so many games with violent content and titles.
",3
"People find ways to get past the chat filter system and say curse words.
",1
"There are tons of online daters and generally immature people.
",1
"There are lots of horny 12 year olds saying ""has s3x"" or ""smokes w33d"" but that was the past update.
",4
"I find that a bad update because people could say ""I'm in the top 3 teams!""
",1
"But the chat filter is not good enough, and scammers run about!
",1
"This leaves lots of opportunities for kids to fall into scams or get themselves injured in real life.
",8
"Also, I made this account because ROBLOX Studio is a piece of crap that doesn't work with game creators like it should.
",2
"Just play the popular games to stay out of bad content.
",3
"Well, other families who write bad reviews should seriously think twice about writing bad reviews.
",2
"Moderators are way too busy dealing with actual problems in ROBLOX to care about minor things that the owner can take care of.
",1
"If you don't like ROBLOX, play something else and don't blame Mods for your lack of care for people like Merely and other mods.
",7
"It's very disrespectful, especially to Erik Cassel.
",8
"If your kid plays a violent game, just tell them to stop or ground them or something, don't blame creators.
",7
"All parents need to do is be a better influence to their children before blaming ROBLOX.
",7
"Stop the madness cmon now im 17 and never had an issue with the game stop trying to sell your virginity to strangers online and you should be good
",6
"I joined roblox 5 years agoand i think its good but the community is horrible.
",6
"kids on there are so mean and rude they cuss scream whine and ruin the game for other kids and i know that teens and adults are the ones getting the blame but in reality its the children and the parents fault because teens and adults are the ones who make and run the games on there if they didn't play roblox it wouldn't be as fun so don't blame the teens or adults for it blame the parents for being less responsible the parents are suppose to run the account so it will be safe and just because its a kids gam
",4
"You can report people if you see anything bad happening, but they cant say how old they are,name or swear words because it will become hashtags.
",1
"Also if you spell something wrong it will also become hashtag but i some games you can see it.
",1
"We all know by now that some people don't like ROBLOX based on some of its news reports about people being pedophiles on the game.
",2
"That doesn't mean we all have to believe in that,  there are internet trolls out there in the universe that can be doing that and we sit here thinking that some semi-big news site says that its bad.
",2
"I played it for almost a year and I don't get anything like satisfying or hating it.
",9
"I agree that it has a  lot of online daters, scammers and hackers, but for the online daters, there's no age 20+ players, because they are adults!
",2
"They don't play games for children, because they are too old to play that.
",4
"ODers are KIDS who just want to turn into an adult.
",7
"Some stupid players.
",0
"By the way, the ""noob"" isn't a bad/cussing word.
",1
"And why do they make the ""Report Abuse"" button?
",7
"For reporting the bad things.
",2
"And it teaches me a lesson: Report anything that is bad.
",4
"I disagree with most of the parents in this review section.
",2
"Yes, most of the games are very inappropriate, but that doesn't mean all of them are!
",2
"Just because most of the Role-playing games are inappropriate, doesn't mean all of them are!
",2
"Yes, there are hackers in the game and might change wallpaper in the game into very bad things, but that doesn't ruin the game!
",2
"If you ever see that kind of stuff on your child's game, just tell them to play a different game or join a different server.
",7
"Yes, some people swear and get away with it by saying it like t h i s or saying each letter in each message, but that doesn't ruin the whole game!
",1
"Yes, Role-Playing games may have people that do adult things, but if that happens, just tell your child to never go on that game again, or just go on a different server of that game!
",7
"Yes, most games have intense violence and such, but you could fix that by just not letting your child play that game every again!
",7
"Yes, bullying happens in most games, but you could turn off the chat for games easily by going to settings and such!
",1
"Yes, most users pretend to be kids and sometimes ask your child their age and home address, but you could make sure you tell your child to ignore them!
",7
"Just because you see something bad in a game, doesn't make the whole game really bad and inappropriate!
",7
"This is a bad thing to say but, if you don't let your child play ROBLOX because you saw one of the things above, you care about your child TOO MUCH.
",7
"I mean, REALLY TOO MUCH.
",0
"CONS:
",0
"Some people can be mean.
",1
"Perhaps way too addicted.
",1
"When my parents told me to get off roblox, I would ignore them or sometimes even start raging.
",0
"But recently, my view on roblox changed from a great social and interactive game to a dark and unsafe one.
",9
"Almost as usual, I ignored her.
",1
"But she was having none of it.
",0
"But then, she looked at my screen and saw me shooting a police man near a bank.
",0
"She looked like she was going to cry.
",0
"I was going to ask her what was wrong, but then I knew.
",0
"In her mind, she was probably thinking: ""Oh why, just why, have I raised a child like this.
",0
"A child who's future is to rob banks and kill people.
",8
"I wanted to cry too.
",5
"All of my friends were prisoners, so I decided to be one too.
",0
"That was decision I would regret for quite a while.
",6
"Not a very safe one, as this is supposed to be a game designed for teens.
",9
"It does censor bad words, but people can still offend other players by, for example, calling them a noob.
",1
"One day, there was a player who could ""hack,"" by killing everyone on the server at once.
",0
"The next morning, my roblox page was a message saying that I was banned for swearing.
",0
"I do occasionally use light profanity such a h**l or d**n, but to the point where I would get banned?
",1
"I was pretty sure there was some hacking going on, and I might just know why.
",0
"Another horrible decision.
",0
"I would sometimes throw my mouse if I got frustrated.
",0
"Now, roblox is blocked.
",2
"My friends in school make fun of me for having overprotective parents.
",4
"I may never be the same sweet and loving kid I once was.
",7
"Depending on your computer, this game might not be worth.
",7
"It's good, but containing games such as ""Murder Mystery 2"" and ""Jailbreak"", it is not for some kids.
",1
"Don't bother for children who get raged easily.
",0
"And yes, lag is frequent.
",9
"Safe chat is also ruined by innuendo and the ability to spell words wrong.
",1
"They put a new filter on it so most swear words don't make it through.
",1
"On certain games there are VERY inappropriate people.
",1
"TL;DR : Too much moderation, Removed the F2P currency.
",2
"so the violence isnt that bad.
",3
"the others are bombs, slingshots, superballs etc.
",7
"there are no really inapropriate games because they get banned fast.
",6
"There are violent games, like swordfighting, but ROBLOX does not show blood.
",3
"there is little bit of violence.And all the people who rate this bad I dont agree.
",2
"ROBLOX is a great game, but players just aren't.
",2
"They act inappropriately, especially in like, ""Have a family and adopt kids,"" or ""Raise a family and adopt kids.."" these people who create those games probably aren't even 13.
",8
"I recommend games with not many animations, animations could be bad for people who have dirty minds, and look like people are well.. yeah..
",1
"Clubs are my least favorited games in roblox, first of all, some dances you have to pay, second of all, some animations are like... wrong.
",8
"People may say dirty things on there, but most likely not.
",1
"But now people are roleplaying as most of them are clickbait game titles.
",1
"Now there's people that are online dating with ruined the whole community, while some people are recording it.
",4
"And if your try to make a game that would be good back in 2008 or 2011 then people would constantly hate on your games and yourself.
",5
"I started to hate it in 2016, when a stranger just asked me for my password, but being the smart person I am I denied it..

"Now there are things that i dislike about this game... 3 stars.

"If you are worried about your 10 year old child being exposed to some idiot that wants to sext your child, think again.

"This guy kept mocking us because we're not in the ""Builder's Club"" which costs about $100 for one person.
",0
"They kept swearing at us and calling us ""poor @$$ noobs"".
",0
"Not just fine.
",7
"I reported the person that made it.
",0
"Then, my account gets banned for a week!
",0
"They said that I ""violated the rules and agreements when I created my account"".

"I think that there is to much violence and to many wepons.
",2
"Inappropriate/sexual games may pop out at least once every two months.
",0
"You may find in-game exploiters but not hackers which would take your account.

"That is FAKE and leads to a virus.

""", I find a lot of dirty-minded people there.

"There has recently been a lot of online dating activity going on in the game, and that frusturates me.

"There is also a lot of account scamming.

"this game are going to pay to win,such a pay to win game,all people keep bad roleplay,with power,meta gaming,etc,,it too uncomfortable if the police keep arresting criminal and bully them then it too uncomfortable,the price are too overpriced,people keep swearing all and over again,this game just for teenager,not for kid because it too dangerous,the game are too violent for child and fullfill of o'der
",7
"Roblox does a great job at trying to avoid cussing and stuff but they can't control it all.
",2
"Some people do decided to walk a around naked but it is rare and shows nothing inappropriate (just skin) Roblox also has many scammers and swearing in certain games.
",1
"What I would recommend to avoid this though is to monitor which games your kid is playing because what I have realized is that the majority of the people who swear or whatever tend to be in games made for developers or group owners or tradesr or e.c.t.
",4
"Btw it Roblox is very anti extreme violence (they do allow pvp though) and blood can be hard to make so it is rarely seen.
",9
"Roblox  seems like a good game well it isn't on this game if u role play people say like 123 for a boy 123 for a girl to get someone to date them or now that u can't say numbers people say ABC.There is another problem people like to swear mistreat people sometimes like saying ""your a noob lol"" or they will say a bad word which it will hashtag out.The dating part well people like to kiss and have s3x and things like that which sometimes some of word like s3x or kiss won't come up because of hashtags but if y
",1
"Obviously, the f-bomb and s-words (yes, both of them) are blocked, as is the word kiss.
",1
"But others, such as the word *cough* that refers to a place opposite of Heaven *cough* is allowed, as is the d-word.
",1
"Other than that, some of the terms that aren't meant to be used in an inappropriate way can be censored, such as asking a friend or foe of their location.
",1
"And certain Meep City private rooms have been home of some sketchy activity lately.
",5
"Do not worry about the website not being safe because it pretty much is.
",2
"However, the chat box is unlimited so you can say pretty much anything you want which is a bit dangerous and people can sometimes bully each other and can say mean things .
",1
"Some games are a bit i guess inappropriate so I recommend being careful on the games you choose to play.
",3
"It's definitely got some fun games, however the community isn't that great, nor the moderation/chat filtering.
",2
"I've even seen sexual games get on the front ""games"" page, however it got deleted by moderators pretty quickly once they noticed.
",6
"And contrary to all of the bad articles going around, while the community is pretty bad, not once of all my 4 years on the site has someone invited me to their house and done ""sexual movements"".
",0
"Buying robux is pushed, users swear despite the rules and filter, and there's some violent shooters, etc, but nothing a more mature kid couldn't handle.
",1
"The only problem that I have with it is that basically everything costs ""ROBUX"", which one has to purchase with real cash.
",6
"In most cases, when it is mass reported, the offensive place (and the player that created it) is banned in short order.
",1
"roblox is absolutly the worst game ever a kid was just bulling me  and all roblox does is ban my account
",0
"However, some of the players want to make stuff that isn't so clean.
",7
"I'd like to say what's wrong with it.
",1
"First off, games can get very gory and violent.
",8
"It shouldn't be hard to guess this is inappropriate.
",2
"Even if you say something like

"""w""

"*new post*

"""o""
",0
"*new post*
",0
"""r""
",0
"*new post*

"""d""
",0
"Roblox can censor it!
",1
"The most common places for loopholes are modern role play games, like high schools, cities and cruise ships.
",8
"The game maker is WAAAAYYY too complicated.
",2
"Of course, most Roblox games still have minor violence, but it's more like taking apart a Lego minifigure than anything.
",3
"Roblox is enjoyable when it comes to playing.I don't like how there is a limit of friends.
",6
"Robux cost real money.Sadly , Roblox took away another thing called tickets.That you just earn for playing.But I guess Roblox went down in equity, so they took away tickets and made things cost more robux,For example, They made a face that cost like 5,030  robux.
",6
"So its unfair for the kids and teens whos parents don't wanna waste their money for them to get more stuff in the game.There is also this thing call Builders Club.
",6
"But there is also stuff for free.You can also favorite ,thumbs up, and thumbs down a game.Some people call the newest members ""noobs"" which is rude.

"Also no grammar whatsoever I know

"Nowadays, it's all about wasting your money for respect, people being gay to each other, moderators and admins doing a poor, lazy job and the community taking everything too seriously.

"It's sad seeing my childhood game turn into a ruined junkyard.
",9
"A classic game ruined by immature and triggered kids.

"Personally, I've been playing roblox ever since June 2012, but it has gone pretty downhill over the years.
",6
"The community has gotten worse, they've made horrible updates, etc.
",9
"I wouldn't really  reccommend (I know,I spelled that wrong) this game too much.
",4
"You also have to pay to get robux to get cool things off of the catalog, and that really angers me, because there used to be this thing called tix.
",8
"But roblox decided that it wasn't good enough apparently (idk why) and removed it.
",0
"TL;DR:  don't play this game, it sucks too much now
",2
"When you play it you come across many undeveloped, horrible, worthless games.
",3
"There is also hackers that hack almost every game.
",8
"The Hashtag moderation is horrible.
",2
"First to start of with the bad ones.
",3
"I think Roblox has literally the worst working against hacking.
",2
"They do NOTHING (almost), about making the game hack safe, as that's for some reason not a priority.
",6
"This means that just by a few searches on youtube, you will get guides how to input inappropriate hacks to all roblox games.
",7
"This is quite serious, and i think roblox knows that but doesn't want to fight against it.
",3
"This IS truely a bad thing.
",7
"There was one bad case of it tho.
",0
"I think it was in 2015 where some hacker, managed to get a VERY inappropriate hacks implomented into a server, on a top 3 game at that time.
",0
"I think it's very false tho, that people say there are many
",2
"pedophiles in roblox.
",8
"So that's so busted.
",0
"Here's actually a funny bad thing about the game.
",2
"Roblox has also done a very hard work on moderating messages and chats in-game now, that it's even become annoying.
",2
"Since it's an MMORPG, it's inevitable that there would be some trolls and predators lurking.
",9
"The first time I played, I saw two players online-dating and using sexual roleplay, which, of course, is not okay.
",0
"The moderators don't really care about abuse reports and the bad words said by players is only censored by hashtags, and usually words that aren't even inappropriate are censored too.
",1
"My brother has picked up on insults such as ""noob"" and often doesn't even know what he's typing back to the players.
",8
"As for the violence: sometimes, if the player wanders into out-of-game space the player will explode and its body parts will fly everywhere with visible blood, accompanied by an ""oof"".
",1
"If the player wields a weapon, it can slice the other players and the body parts will fall off, accompanied by blood.
",3
"Sex on roblox its a tragedy I thought roblox was a really good game but what I saw changed me.

"There is blood and lots of consumerism you can buy things called ""robux"" there are rumors about someone called ""John doe"" people say he will hack you wich will freak out the youngest of children and Roblox is really violent depending on which game you play
",6
"The worst part is the community.
",9
"I am going to be honest, reporting doesn't work.
",2
"Roblox would obviously ban people with inappropriate usernames or games but it would usually take them about a week or even a month to ban or even give a warning to someone who is bullying someone in-game.
",6
"The staff of Roblox are horrible.
",9
"They create horrible games, events and mostly items that people don't even like.
",8
"They basically never even talk to the community and just do what the company wants to do without even notifying players.
",7
"They removed Tix because you need to pay money to get Robux and you got 10 Tix a day (Would take months to actually buy something though) so basically you have to buy in-game money.

"The community is probably 60% bad but maybe thats just me.
",2
"DO NOT play Roblox Highschool, MeepCity, any tycoon game, City Life or any game where it has a bad quality thumbnail.

"Those games are usually full of inappropriate people such as, people getting into online relationships, people bullying/harassing others and even people attempting to have sex.

"People would find out ways on how to get past the safe chat and use roleplay names to talk sexually to other people.

"ROBLOX doesn't do anything about it and the reporting doesn't work for the heck of it.

"Consumerism is down right ridiculous.

"$200 for 20,000 ROBUX which isn't even worth it and Builders Club which is also ridiculous but back then before 2013, you could get lifetime Builders Club which was in the price of $100-$350 which I found not worth it unless the person is a developer.
",6
"I don't find it worth it because someday, your kid could stop playing the game or get hacked which could ruin your kids day or possibly life.

"Most people complain about like the messaging system.
",7
"Another thing, these parents be like I hate it 18+ When I haven't heard a story where the parent plays roblox...
",0
"Roblox is horrible and you shouldn't let your kids play it.
",7
"These exploits load scripts, and run then directly in the game.
",9
"This is bad, because it allows people to run anything, including graphic sexual imagery, drugs, violence, and in some cases leak IP Addresses.
",1
"That was an example of too much consumerism.
",0
"ROBLOX has good filtering, but they get too many false positives.
",2
"Also, the filtering gets bypassed too easily.
",1
"The games are mostly gore related.
",3
"I recommend that ages 12+ only play this game.
",2
"More and more do I see complaints and news articles about how unsafe ROBLOX is for kids, from pedophilia to verbal abuse.
",2
"The main reason why kids are falling into these unsafe traps are the parents.
",7
"Parents that don't do anything and don't moderate their child's online usage will suffer the consequences of how they will grow up as an adult and use the internet for the rest of their life.
",8
"I have checked it out and feel that everyone is exaggerating.
",8
"I have never seen any user chat anything more graphic then ""damn"".
",1
"I have never seen any pedos or inappropriate content.
",1
"The term noob is a basic insult that should be taken as lightly as possible.
",2
"It's like the word ""dumb"", meaningless and infantile.
",9
"My family thinks it's a virus, but I know it isn't.
",0
"I've seen many people accusing ROBLOX that there reporting system is broken, it doesn't work.
",1
"Ask the ROBLOX team, will they tell you that its broken?
",7
"People think because people don't get banned right away when they report them, they accuse them of the system being broken, and  when other people see that, they think that too and accuse them, but ask them, ask them how it's broken?
",2
"But, there's some bad things on ROBLOX too.
",1
"There's also people who HACK and EXPLOIT the game, and they could insert SEXUAL CONTENT never meant for kids.
",6
"I've seen it all before, People hacking the game, deleting things (although it's only for one server, but everyone on that server won't be able to play the game right), exploiting, killing people, putting sexual content, if you go on YouTube and search up ""roblox s3x place"" and set the filter to Today, you will get atleast 3 or 4 videos.
",7
"The moderation team is always there to ban it.
",2
"But there's concerns going around about safety and privacy, because apparently people are saying their locations.
",1
"But, if you ask me, that's the PARENT'S FAULT.
",7
"They blame it on ROBLOX just because they said it there, but isn't it really there fault that their child said their private information?
",7
"Shouldn't they be telling them ""Don't do that!""
",7
"I'll bet you most parents don't even care about it until it actually happens and they freak out.
",6
"Remember how I said my family (or other people) think that ROBLOX is a virus?
",0
"If everyone knew it was a virus, why would there be thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, people on RIGHT NOW?
",0
"Why would they put it on every platform?
",7
"To get a sick laugh when people get viruses?
",6
"If you look below this, you'll see I selected ""Too much swearing"" or ""Too much violence"" and all that, but I'm not saying there's TOO much (thanks to the moderation team) but there is some that you should look out for.

"And I will fail.

"And I will, look like an idiot.

"Roblox is not a good game at all for young kids.
",2
"Once Roblox practically broke my computer!
",6
"Although Roblox could be fun there is online dating and even worst things.Once I played this game called ""battle of the sexes"" I reported the game because it was very inappropriate.
",0
"A lot of inappropriate things happened in that game.
",1
"DON'T PLAY ROBLOX UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE
",0
"A noticable one has been the removal of the currency, ""tickets"".
",6
"When tickets were removed, there was a huge outrage, etc etc.
",8
"But the thing that everyone is very angry about is their filter.
",2
"The filter blocks good words and abbreviations such as ""ik"" (means ""I know"".)
",1
"Users over the age of 13 receive a blacklist filter, but it's still annoying to see ""##### #### ### #"" instead of actual words, and sometimes even the blacklist is too easily triggered.
",7
"Also, if you go back to the tickets problem, a lot of people would say that ROBLOX just removed tickets to get people to buy BC, or just straight buy robux.
",6
"Please be cautious as some comntent is not suitable.
",9
"The site, while it has a plethora of games, has been removing so much features and hoping we ignore it by giving something a shiny new look.
",6
"The community staff never comment on it despite players requesting for some sort of explanation for these sorts of things.
",9
"The staff have become lazy overtime, this is coming from someone who played this since 2010.
",2
"Where once they gladly gave a grade A effort in what they do they now do host events that are uninspired, keep the site bland compared to the years where they would keep it spiffy and even change it during the holidays.
",5
"It's a shame to see the site become what it is, sure the games are great!
",7
"by no means do I want to bash the young developers who pour their heart and soul into their creations, the staff on the other hand have just been the butt end of every joke.
",9
"Honestly, you people are getting this all wrong.
",2
"ROBLOX does not allow swearing nor sex in their user created games.
",1
"They try hard to find these games and delete them and the account who made the game.
",5
"They are a child friendly game and all the games who have ""sex"" in them and are popular games are most likely exploited or ""hacked"" by someone.
",8
"Some parents like to give it a hard time because of profanity, but over the years hashtags have been placed over many words that could be considered offensive, such as stupid.
",1
"I mean come on!
",1
"Minecraft doesn't bleap out swear words but you guys put all of the hate on Roblox.
",1
"My only complaint is that it can occasionally bleap out random words such as censorship and the letter x
",1
"This game just sucks, it's filled with 5 year olds who cant bother to even google an insult.
",3
"Here's the typical insult they throw out, Noob.
",2
"Not only that, the moderation is complete garbage, anyways, good luck.
",1
"ROBLOX is a game that was made a long time ago.
",0
"There is a lot of safety and privacy concerns as there are people that are paedophiles and they try to lure children.
",8
"There are also scams which take away people's accounts.
",8
"They removed TIX (It's like ROBUX but you get 10 daily and it was free).
",6
"The fact that they removed tix showed that they were becoming greedy and wanted more people to buy robux (in-game currency) and Builders Club (membership).
",6
"There is also quite a lot of violence which I am not really affected by as a teen, but for kids it can be quite awkward.
",2
"ROBLOX can drain your money when you buy membership and there are also lots of people that have the freedom to swear and curse in the same games as little innocent kids.
",1
"I don't think it's right and it shouldn't be fair for little kids to be experiencing harsh things in their childhood.
",8
"ROBLOX used to be a great game but it's now turned into trash.
",0
"The dating can also affect kids because some people can end up bullying and other things.
",8
"Also, the fact that random people can harass or bully little kids is just unfair, isn't it?
",4
"Before, ROBLOX used to have an age rating of 8-14 because it wasn't as bad as now.
",2
"Perhaps it still is 8-14, but for me, I think it is 10+ because of all the violence and other problems.
",2
"Other things that families out there should be concerned about is that they shouldn't spend too much money on ROBLOX because it can get risky and after a while, your child may even think that it was a lost cause because they themselves will soon realise how much of a rip-off it was.
",6
"If you are a kid, be careful of what you do if you play ROBLOX and ask your parents for anything that goes wrong because they end up badly if you don't.
",7
"The fact that the chat systems have changed is bad because of laws and regulations, the chat is filled with hashtags (#) because lots of silly words are being censored.
",1
"Just by typing a number in the chat can sometimes end up as hashtags, which is stupid.
",1
"If you all are reading this and you haven't got ROBLOX, please think carefully about what you do because it can lead badly if you don't think twice about downloading ROBLOX.
",7
"Some people have lost their toast when they find a chat message that is sexual,  swearing, and personal questions.
",4
"Just beware, some games are hacked and a friend got a virus playing once.
",0
"make sure they know not to accept friend request that they dont know and if somebody swears you can report an abuse and the games are fine including twisted murderer it doesnt look realistic thats why
",7
"I was playing a game when all of a sudden the wallpaper turned into some inappropriate stuff.
",0
"When I reported the hacker I left the game immediately and went to a social game to hang out.
",0
"Now the year is 2017 and the new owners of roblox deleted tix from the game and people started making these tix memorial worlds.
",9
"I rarely ever see someone saying wanna have sex or make babies.
",7
"or, ""You shouldn't say that other kids are playing this game be the better example.""
",4
"Been on roblox since 2011, it went downhill in 2016-17.
",6
"You can't search certain users' names, because they get tagged, the censoring is broken and disgusts me.
",1
"Devs at roblox don't care about the users or their opinions, they do what makes them happy and everything that draws in more money.
",6
"Greedy game developers.
",0
"They removed tickets, which was the only way people who did not want to spend money on the game could purchase items to customise their characters.
",6
"Don't play roblox, save yourself from the trouble.
",7
"Despite some children doing messed up things in some games.
",2
"but my main problem is honestly roblox updates.
",2
"the censoring is too much.
",1
"i understand you're trying to hide any cuss words but you dont need to censor ""i, me, a, my"" or any other words.
",1
"Play at your own risk :/
",7
"In some cases, you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy, so be cautious.
",9
"The community isn't its greatest, and sometimes, things happen which are bad enough to be reported to the news.
",2
"Games can have, but not always, violence or horror.
",3
"You should not let your child play boys and girls hangout because there are older kids, bully's, and some pretend to have s3x by laying down and crying like sucking.
",2
"The only problem I have with ROBLOX is its community, which some players online date, To prevent this, turn on safe chat.
",1
"Also, those angry parent reviews - Don't listen to them.
",2
"Those are over- protective parents who do not prepare their kids for the real world.
",3
"Now however, it is filled with violence, exploitation, inappropriate content and extreme levels of consumerism.
",2
"little kids who will constantly get angry and threaten you with ""i will ban u!'.
",8
"Grown adults cussing out the other players or making fun of them because they aren't ""rich"".
",7
"Even the Roblox corporation doesn't do its job correctly.
",2
"If you report someone and you actually have a reason to report them, NOTHING HAPPENS!
",7
"That, and you're practically forced to buy clothing and hats because of how much the other players will make fun of you for looking like a ""noob"" or ""nub"".
",6
"I play Roblox for 4 and a half months 2016-2017 and I played meepcity, work at the pizza place and... ok I'll stop and I saw people calling NOOBS and I didn't so Dad saw 
",0
"Roblox and he go to common sense media and he saw this game is not safe for kids
",0
"And I end up got banned for Roblox.
",0
"I'm not allowed to play Roblox until I'm an adult (18+ or 21+) so parents if your child is playing Roblox.
",7
"Please removed him because it's too much violence too much dating and too much swearing.
",2
"So please avoid this game try playing lego life (there New), club penguin, poptropica, or some other place your child can play.
",7
"I have had my account since 2012 and have not seen games like this at all, you will only find these if you go looking, and you would need to look quite hard!
",7
"Violence, If you think a block character made up of 6 different parts (15 with the new R15 look) falling apart is ""violent"" then let your kid play hello kitty games instead, and for games with blood in them, the blood doesnt look realistic and is normally blurry o pixelated decals that look more like jelly than blood.
",3
"I have had people ask for my password, But I have always just messed around with these people instead and ended up reporting them (This has only happened once out of 5 years of playing).
",0
"I saw a review where someone gave it 18+ age rating becuase you can buy stuff with money, they said that everything must be bought or something.
",0
"It only gives you new clothes and access to new games that arnt that great.
",3
"If you are really that worried about roblox, watch your kid play it, I know its an iffy game because of how mostly everything is run by the users but isnt that a good thing?
",7
"THis game is one of the most pathedic game outtheir.
",9
"I have played it and they delbritly attack the Roleplay communitie and scam you out of your money.
",4
"DO NOT play this game as it Not only is a completle SCAM But they Kill creativity!
",5
"I have played this ame for four year and the new update Scams people out of their money and does not allow for fun interaction with other players.
",3
"They try to be child friendly but these IDIOTS!
",7
"Dnt realize that  You cant protect everyone from the outside world.
",8
"Most of the new ""Moderations"" are not even needed to be modderated This game is worthless do not play this game for your life!
",3
"ITs not worth it.
",6
"Once again the Delibretly attack communities at random times for random reasons.
",1
"Foul words I would get... but many words are not bad words such as members of a group or HELLO 
",1
"You cannot talk to other players if you are under the age of 13 wich was great but apparently Now everyone is five years old and is no longer allowed to talk like a normal human being....
",4
"This is what I have to say to roblox
",7
"STOP Just STOP your Going to kill your game... 
",7
"ROBLOX SUCKS!!!
",0
"And I will Restate this They REMOVED creativity and attacked players creativities by shutting down roleplay games and filling up the talk scedual so badly that everything is is this #############################################################################################################################################################
",7
"It will look fammiler and It will be spammed once roblox is done ""Protecting"" everyone
",9
"First of all, ROBLOX isn't really a game.
",2
"For these games to contain images, the images MUST be reviewed before they can even be viewed in the game, meaning no bad content can pass.
",2
"The chat filter system, while overly strict and getting quite annoying, is very protective, and prevents almost, if not all bad language from reaching players under 13 years of age.
",1
"Players over that age can see slightly more, but still no words that are extremely bad.
",1
"A lot of it can be down to parenting, where parents are failing to teach children about internet safety, and therefore letting their kids do things which aren't exactly...
",8
"This game can have hackers in any game and online dating happens a lot I'm not sure if people give out private info off game because I always say no to people who ask, beside that there are many different types of maps on roblox, but some are inappropriate and are usually deleted by the roblox  company after a day.
",5
"Roblox  just recently had a new update you can't say any numbers its very cautious now so cautious I couldn't say the word cat or the name Ashley for a role play name or Sydney there are almost to cautious and I presume that pretty soon teens my age will stop playing this game due to how high cautious they are making this game but, all in all this game is great for kids around the age of 10 and up the game is very cautious about most things except hackers who sneak on certain servers of a game recently I ha
",4
"This can be a concern because there are possibilities of scammers and creeps on the chat.
",8
"This is a small concern since I have only come across one scammer in my 4 years playing Roblox, and no one creepy.
",0
"I only used this game for less than a year and I seen it all.
",6
"NOT good for kids that are depressed easily by CONSTANT bullying and trolling.
",4
"the amount of trolling is INSANE in this game.
",9
"every game you go on to, there is at least ONE troll/ bully in a game.
",4
"AND they hammer you for not having a builders pass/ robux.
",4
"they call your dad ""poor"" [personal experience] because we can't afford this.
",0
"Roblox's ""safe chat"" is RIDICULOUS.
",2
"It censors out a lot of things that I type that are not offensive and DOESN'T censor out the BAD STUFF!
",1
"AND poses a security threat.
",5
"like you can literally GIVE your address to someone who you don't even know.
",7
"*ugh.
",0
"and you have to pay for like EVERYTHING!
",7
"EVEN SIMPLY CHANGING YOUR NAME / PASSWORD cost 1000 ROBUX!!
",7
"[keep in mind that 400 robux cost 5 bucks] if I could sum this game up in ONE word, it would be DEPRESSING.
",6
"I would recommend Role Play games to children 12 and up, as little children may not be able to understand the content, and will not know to tell a parent if they see something that shouldn't be on the game.
",7
"Shooting games such as Phantom Forces can be very violent and show blood, not in a realistic way though.
",3
"There is not an option to remove chat, but it should be easy to avoid.
",3
"Anything that is not recognized will be put into hashtags.
",9
"IF the child is 13 or over then the words they can choose from have the opposite safety.
",7
"A Blacklist is a list of words that can't be said, this includes spaces to make sure people who don't follow the rules can't find ways into the chat.
",1
"It will ask if you want to report abuse from a  player or from the game.
",7
"However that will cost you 20,000,000 ROBUX in exchange.
",6
"Stay away from small games/groups with little players, these are often targets for trolls/exploiters.
",9
"Some players may try to scam you for ROBUX.
",5
"Don't risk your account just for a small benefit.
",9
"Roleplaying,sex,idiots,bullies,noob looks, Etc.
",0
"hello I am a what you could call ""fellow ROBLOX player"" and I must say first hand this game is not safe for kids.
",4
"It is true that most games on this website are violent such examples would be ""Phanton Forces"" which is basically the equivalent to call of duty.
",8
"The roleplaying games are bad too.
",2
"You have people that have children and go to clubs and you have what are called ""ODers"" (Online Daters"" which are a real thing.
",4
"another thing I almost forgot is the moderation is not good.
",9
"people insult other people all the time, and for those parents that say it helps their kids to learn how to spell, I am afraid not because there are a lot of people in this game that do not know grammar very well.
",4
"I do not recommend this game to be shown to kids.
",4
"Don't look at the other reviews, they are very outdated.
",2
"I would recommend to not play any ""Town Roleplay games"", such as MeepCity, or ROBLOX High school, because they have a lot of online dating.
",4
"These games have guns, but there is little to no gore, unless you count fake looking blood ""gore"".
",8
"IF YOU WANT TO GET HACKED!!
",0
"In fact, a sexual predator once hacked a kids computer though this site.
",0
"Even if you DON'T get hacked or have a virus from this site, the ""report player"" dose not even work.
",5
"I once reported someone for putting the C-Word in the open chat, and MY account was almost shut off for trying TO report him.
",0
"This isn't the first time that has happened to someone.
",0
"It could be simple and friendly or complex and incredibly violent, sexual, profane, uses of drugs, or worse.
",1
"Very bad site.
",1
"Unless you know how to counter a virus or a hack, then you should stay away.
",7
"Too bad though, SOME games are actually pretty good.
",2
"This means that there are HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of games, which, yes, some are scams and games with massive penises.
",3
"Now firstly, if you're complaining about bad moderation or people like forum trolls, firstly: welcome to the internet, and secondly with the mass amounts of user created content coming in each day it's almost impossible to moderate it all.
",2
"If you are someone complaining about people swearing, well, there's actually some really strict filters in ROBLOX.
",1
"Give the people a bad review not the game.
",1
"If you are playing a game which is hacked and has penises flying everywhere, this isn't their fault.
",1
"It is completely up to the developers to make their games secure, and if your child is playing a poorly created game then that's what they have to pay.
",7
"Lastly, I've noticed that lately there's been a lot of consumerism in roblox.
",4
"And this is completely true, I will have to admit it is a negative, although please keep in mind that they have to pay for servers and whatnot.
",1
"So in conclusion, I am giving this game a 4 star review for the reasons I've mentioned before, and the negatives below:
",0
"
",0
"-I've been banned for no reason multiple times
",0
"-Sex games
",3
"-Consumerism
",0
"There are swearing even though there are ""*"" thingy
",3
"Because people can still put space in dirty words

"2.
",0
"DO NOT USE YOUR MONEY FOR THIS GAME
",0
"I once used some money for buying tix but then after a while all my tix I bought is gone
",0
"3.
",0
"There are hackers
",8
"Some people just hack the game and win the game - no justice
",8
"4.
",0
"Not safe for gamers
",4
"There are chance to get a virus while playing a online game
",5
"And you doesn't even know 4/5 of the people
",3
"A lot of blood in these gun-shooting games
",3
"There are games with bars/pub where you can have sex or alcohol
",1
"Players made these games
",3
"Most of the games are a waste of time
",2
"
",0
"Thanks for reading I hope this helped.
",6
"However, I really didn't see the point.
",2
"It's basically an MMORPG without the things that make an MMORPG  good, like character levels and upgrades.
",2
"So I got bored with it quickly.
",6
"And all she does is role play or do obstacle courses that result in her screaming in frustration, much to our dismay.
",6
"This has been a rant about an ok game, just not worth sitting down to play 6 hours or more.
",6
"this is a fun game for littler kids but as you get older it can get boring.
",2
"So heres the deal, Roblox has gotten alot more dangerous Since I joined.
",9
"This game is safe but can be prone to something called exploits, or mainly called hacking (It isnt really hacking but it can destroy the particular server, it wont affect the other servers for the game) exploits can allow users to display bad content for kids.
",1
"I would teach your kids to identify and report innapropreate material.
",7
"And report exploiters for exploitng.
",2
"Reporting more than once lowers punishment priority.
",4
"Roblox will then usually do something to punish the user who broke the TOS.
",5
"Stay away from the forums (Roblox talk, Off topic only needed blocked) unless they are 11 and up and know how to report offensive content.
",0
"Shooting games usually have blood disablers for the sensitive so use this and dont punish your kids instead!
",1
"Most war groups have trainings and some may not be ok with that.
",8
"There is no way to get free robux.
",5
"Censoring prooves no benefit and actually makes kids attempt to get past the strict censoring.
",9
"But the trolls are HORRIBLE.
",3
"Calling people noobs and horrible.
",4
"Multiple times a day I would be called stupid, swear words, and called words that should not be uttered on this website.
",8
"They swear, talk about ""Doing Drugs"", and over all find joy in calling people ""That Stupid Girl"".
",0
"Overall, unless the trolls are taken care of, then don't play this game.
",3
"Some of these ppl have yt channels like nilvou which btw hes gotten banned many times on roblox.So there are some downfalls to it but other than the negative parts its pretty lit tbh.
",1
"People swear but it is replaced with hashtags.
",1
"So... A lot of adults are complaining about predators on this game...
",2
"I admit, one time, Roblox was as toxic as 4Chan, but, with the fact that a big Youtuber is playing the game, Roblox mods are cracking down on this stuff.
",2
"And for the terrorist and nazi stuff?
",9
"As soon as it get released, someone reports it, and BOOM.
",6
"The game is taken down.
",9
"Also, some of the reviews are obvious trolls.

"Seriously, A Brock Lesnar fetish?

"Doubt it.

"Read a gaming slang dictionary please.

"Noob means New player or Stupid Player.

"Please do not read the parent reviews, I beg you all.

"The community is a mixed bag due to the sudden overflow of DanTDM Fans.
",7
"Please, Hear me out, If you want to ban your kids from this game.
",7
"Why are parents acting seriously about all of this?
",2
"It is a silly game where i have encountered few examples of what parents are talking about.
",8
"When i find a game too violent or is indecent, I just ignore it, Report it, And move on.
",3
"But i am not so crazy about it that i would scream, and scream, and scream, and pout, All about all day over.
",0
"Violence.
",0
"It is the main concern about this innocent game, I just ignore them.
",3
"If your kids are complaining about violent games or you witness them playing one, Then they are simply not mature enough about it.
",3
"I think the parent audience is over-reacting.
",3
"People say its inappropriate for kids, well that's not true!
",1
"AllSeason  said something about a sex thing, what is wrong with you?

"I play speed games  because FPS SUCKS!

"The was a creepy guy who said he wanted to $@&@ me but I told him that I was ten and he was being a pervert.

"There's also a terrible community.
",3
"Some of the games are made by idiots that promote online dating, and the moderation is not handled well.
",1
"I personally think that if kids want to play this game, parents should come and check every 15 minutes or so, since your kid may be playing a perverted game.
",7
"Some games are violent.
",3
"It promotes kids to buy robux so they can get that pointless digital items.
",9
"However, Games like Phantom Forces, Apocalypse Rising and Counter Blox: ROBLOX Offensive may not be appropriate for your kids.
",4
"Also, Some games I Played were Sexual.

"The only thing I Disliked was being insulted and threatened.

"Not only does it have a poor moderation system because exploiting is very common on the game and inappropriate images/language can be inserted anywhere by exploiters.

"It also has a poor moderation system because ROBLOX will ban your child for ANYTHING.

",9
"You're probably reading this because your son/daughter has been playing idiot constantly.

"Now the only way to buy clothes is buy paying REAL money.

"Nowadays however, all of those fun games turn into really awful, stupid OD'er (online dater) games.

"It's absolutely ridiculous.
",0
"Most of the community are really immature and childish saying things like: 's--t' 'f--k,' the 'N' word yet they claim to be 18 and billionaires.
",1
"I used to love ROBLOX until the updates ruined everything, the developers are ignorant to their community and the community are disrespectful, spoiled brats.
",9
"Oh, and by spoiled brats I mean kids whose parents LITERALLY SPEND $130 JUST FOR A MEMBERSHIP FOR A YEAR!
",3
"The admins are really stupid because the offender never gets banned even though you report him, and YOU get banned for false reporting.
",5
"I'm annoyed by the game, and I want to warn younger people that how this really nice lego-looking game can deceive you and that you should ALWAYS play with your parent's supervision.
",7
"For example, if someone says ""Your a bitch"" it says ""Your a #####"" so it does not allow swearing.
",5
"It also does not allow kids to use there real names.

"Some games that are worked on by professionals have good graphics, which is normally blood spewing everywhere when you die.
",2
"There are also some very psychologically disturbing horror games with very scary jump scares: Silent Dark, Roses.
",3
"In the Chat people say stuff like S**t but its not censored, but when you say S**ts then it censors.
",1
"However, this game has some urgent issues that need to be mentioned to parents.
",6
"I played this for real and seeing this being exposed to kids me really, really sad.
",0
"Roblox has certain positives but you can never trust what they say.
",5
"Kids who play this money trap will experience negative developments for example swearing or become enraged when a challenge is too difficult to overcome.
",5
"Yes, too bad it's at the bottom of the unpopular depths of games.
",5
"Certain games are just completely confusing.
",3
"The immediate problem every parent should see is that they have their own catalog.
",4
"Kids are begging their parents to buy in-game currency which costs REAL money.
",6
"Parents, I URGE YOU to stop your children from playing this massacre because in a few years, they will learn to swear and become violent.
",8
"I have become a victim of that too.
",9
"I've been on Roblox for years and just finally quit it.
",0
"The gaming mechanic system is good and you can build a lot of detailed buildings, but the community is horrifying.
",2
"I've had to at least drop SEVEN toxic friends on there.
",9
"The moderating system is absolutely awful.
",2
"You cannot report a person properly without getting labelled unfairly for false reporting.
",2
"The chat system is bad and you will always at least see someone swearing.
",1
"There are violent games which requires you to brutally beat up people.
",3
"You at least need money to buy robux in order to properly purchase clothing items, and you cannot get anything without robux whatsoever.
",7
"This game is NOT for children.
",6
"I would recommend that this game for teenagers if they like independant complex game making and building, but the community is absolute trash.
",4
"Don't bother playing.
",6
"Most the puzzles on roblox are meant for 16+ it gets younger children frustrated, And people online date, Some people find ways to swear and avoid the chat filters most the moderators let children say stuff they shouldn't be allowed to and ban them for saying random stuff, If they think its bad they normally turn it into hashtags but My sister's daughter tried to type 'Anyone wanna be my friend?'
",1
"And roblox blocked it, Are you not allowed friendship?
",5
"And when younger children try to build their own games its very hard, I suggest your child\Children should jsut play Minecraft or Animal Jam.

"If you let your child play this for even a day, they will probably ask you for one of these upgrades.
",7
"You can't buy anything if you don't have the in-game currency, robux.
",7
"There used to be another currency called tickets, however they were removed in April 2016 due to them being 'useless'.
",6
"You should be careful when browsing the groups you can join, as some of them go against religious and political beliefs.
",3
"There is also the issue of inappropriate posts, which blatantly go against the rules.
",5
"The game STINKS.
",0
"Its addictive and has some fun games, but for the rest of the games people call you offensive slurs, make innapropiate jokes, call you names, its just horrible.
",4
"If your child doesnt know any of that, hes going to be getting exposed early.
",7
"Well, this game has a ton of O'ding ( Online Dating ) which is against the rules, but no one seems to do anything about it, it has way too much swearing.
",2
"Sometimes, people like to ""troll"" ( To mess with you or something ) and they can either try to troll you sexually or just bully you in some sort of way, which I know you wouldn't like, considering you're here looking for some reviews.
",7
"There's a lot of cyberbullies, and naughty talk.
",5
"To be truthfully, I have been playing this game since I was 10-11 (6 years, jfc) and It only started to get bad in 2012 when exploiters started to take over.
",0
"Everyone partook in messing with everything.
",4
"Spammers, Hackers and even Online Daters.
",1
"Now it's getting more strict with blocking out basically everything you say in game.
",1
"There's not that many exploiters in game, but do beware of scammers giving out false links to steal your information.
",8
"First I'll start out with the bad about this game.
",3
"I'm 14 years old, and the only reason I play this game is because I have a very slow computer (I am upgrading this Christmas).
",0
"The game has a not-so-great community, and the moderation is not so good.
",2
"The people that complain about their accounts getting hacked are just not educated on internet safety and have likely given their password to others.
",7
"There are a handful of games with custom chat engines (as opposed to the Roblox one) that offer less than adequate censoring of profanity, but the majority of games are fine.
",8
"There is an unbelievable about of scamming and spamming on the site with the comments section of 99% of games being nothing but ""Repost on five games for free 999999999 Robux,(the games premium currency)""or ""Go to (insert malware link here) for free Robux!""
",4
"There are quite a few cyber bullies on the internet and Roblox is no exception.
",2
"However, people will always cyber bully.
",1
"If you do not want your children to ever be insulted(which I completely understand), than I advise you to keep your children far from any internet site.
",7
"However, the heavy consumerism is the worst part of the site.
",1
"There are banner ads on every single page, and the scamming in the comments doesn't help either.
",1
"This is more of a minor annoyance than a safety concern for parents.
",2
"Many of the horrible ages 18+ parent reviews are very outdated from a time where the moderation team did absolutely nothing about hackers and pornography in the user created games, but now the team bans users permanently for major offenses and bans after some warnings for minor ones.
",2
"Summary: Roblox is an online game that will inevitably have people that try to bully children and try to scam them, but if parents take the necessary steps to teach their children about bullies and computer viruses, their children will be just fine.
",5
"I've played Roblox since 2012, and if you say something wrong, or spell it wrong your insulted.
",7
"I once said something to this guy, he banned me from a server, then threatened me he would destroy my reputation.
",0
"And there are games where you decapitate people!
",4
"Games where you shoot people.
",3
"People will call you horrible names like f--got and other harsh things.
",8
"You're considered a noob on how you look!
",7
"This game certainly is not what they say it is.
",2
"So...There's a lot of dating and nasty things!
",2
"I mean like come on nude avatars??
",2
"This has a ton of guns and bloody things...I've seen people using codes that make bad words!
",1
"like the F word!
",1
"Roblox has a ton of websites that say they give free thing which mostly need there password which then they lose there accounts!
",5
"They prices are very high 5$ for 80 robux it should be more like 2$
",8
"There is now a swear word filter which is pretty buggy as it censors lots of random things.
",1
"It doesnt fix the many many issues with its community.
",1
"Roblox is by far notourious for its very toxic community.
",9
"Issues such as Racism, Sexual activity and general harrasment.
",8
"The fact that loads of these kids have no manners is really bad.
",4
"Too add insult to injury the Report system doesnt work.
",1
"All it does is warns users rarely banning them (banning only happens to Hackers).
",5
"There are also weird games where users can go into hot tubs and stuff and as you might guess they contain sexual activity.
",2
"Its very sad seing that an app designed for kids has the most toxic community in any gaming fandom.
",9
"Been playing it for 4 years, but, sadly, the community is T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E!
",2
"Ok, ok, I might have been overreacting a bit, but the community is really bad...
",2
"
",0
"Oh man, I have so much to write about the community...
",2
"I'll start from the least worse, to the worst:
",9
"
",0
"Ok, number 1: Popularity: 
",5
"Most games that are popular are mad murderer games, tycoons, ""roleplaying"" games, scams, or just free-modeled copies... One of the reasons I stopped playing ROBLOX so often like I used to, btw.
",8
"Number 2: The radio: There's a radio option for many games, yet *almost* everyone who uses the radio plays annoying music, or MLG stuff.
",1
"These kids think they're better than anyone because they have expensive hats and their parents bought them BC...  
",6
"
",0
"B.
",0
"When they saw me, they called the hair I chose ugly, now, I'm fine with opinions, but not only they shared their opinion on me, they also started bullying me, yep, that's right...
",0
"I was bullied for a hairstyle, I got a bit offended I guess, so I responded to them with ""how mature of you..."" then they said something like, ""oh god, not this type of person!""
",0
"I remember that they kept on bullying me a little more, then they muted me...
",0
"
",0
"C. Da K00l Kidz:
",0
"Often seen hanging out in games like ""Club Sanity"" or ""Club Boats"", they are seen in groups and act like they're better than everyone...
",2
"They often call you a noob, or ODer, which brings us to those with the prejudices:
",6
"
",0
"D. Ever heard of ""don't judge a book based on its cover""?
",3
"There are also a type of players with prejudices that don't judge you exactly, they just have prejudices.
",3
"I went to a FPS ROBLOX game, and some guy told me that I won't win 'cause I'm a girl.
",0
"I've also saw many people who use the word ""g@y"" as an insult, and people who use the word n1gga, or nigg3r alot...
",1
"
",0
"E. The mods: They aren't technically players... but they are a still a part of this community...
",3
"The mods are... well... eh, not great...
",2
"I reported someone for ODing, yet for some reason *I* was the one who got banned, and for the SAME reason I reported that someone!
",0
"And I don't even OD... Not only for that I was banned, 
",0
"I was also banned for a random meme I uploaded: It was a Captain America image that on it was written: ""I want you to watch your language!""
",0
""", breaking ROBLOX rules, and when you tell them(some) that what they're doing is breaking the rules and illegal, they attack you and say stuff like: ""I'LL DO WHATEVER I WANT"" and stuff...
",5
"
",0
"Whoops, sorry, seems like I ranted... Anyways, the game's great, the community is very bad, and the mods aren't great aswell...
",2
"If your like me u can't get Robux and all the other people around u are using there's left and right and there u are with the starter crap.
",1
"It's unfair we shouldn't be spending money on Avatars, MORE CLOTHING NEEDS TO BE FREE!
",6
"I was surprised to hear all the whining from these parents.
",9
"True, the community has increasingly gone down hill throughout the years, but that is to be expected as the game grows.
",4
"It is much like any place on the internet with trolls, hackers, scammers, and spammers, but know this...
",2
"It is not humanly possible to monitor the whole site at once.
",4
"Since the content is all user created, Roblox can not be held responsible for the actions of others.
",3
"Purchases are not required for overall game play, cyber bullies should not be taken seriously and reported immediately, and privacy/safety should not be an issue if the child is taught right.
",2
"Becpise a lot of kids wanna play on their phones but it doesn't work pls fix it
",5
"Some games are inappropriate for some.
",1
"You can report people for doing bad things.
",1
"Violence - even official games (like Crossroads) can have cartoonish violence,  prison and murder games have violence that is surprising for a game with an E10+ rating
",3
"Sex - Online Dating, Role Play Dating and ""Push Ups"" are common
",8
"Language - The one that breaks the E10+ barrier, there was a bunch of ""damns"" and ""hells"" by the ROBLOX community.
",9
"Money - ROBLOX tries to eat off money with their memberships, and they did this because they said "" Outrageous Builders Club"" (highest cost) is BEST VALUE!
",6
"i bet they didn't watch the video.
",6
"Sex - PhireFox, a machinima person talks about Sex commonly, but not as much as Alberts Stuff, which is a ROBLOX Let's Player that is COMPLETELY inappropriate, a sexual reference is when he called ""Apocalypse Rising"" ""Acockolypse Rising""
",1
"Swearing - The videos can range from kid friendly (Denis, DanTDM) to adults only (Alberts Stuff, That Blue Panda Guy) these contain lots of swearing, such as the F word, the B word, the T word, the D word, the H word, the S word and EVEN THE N WORD!
",1
"Drugs - Lots of them
",7
"Money - They always ask to subscribe and some of them (including DanTDM) have YouTube Red Only Videos!
",0
"Privacy - There are scam websites, fake giveaways and cyberbullying

",0
"I've played Roblox for about 4-6 years and as a little kid I was abused on that game, so I did what other people do: Report on the abuser.
",0
"I thought that guy would be banned in hours, but after days of playing that guy continued to stalk me across the site of Roblox, alas he was never banned.
",0
"AND ALSO THE ITEMS ROBLOX WAS SELLING WAS REEEEALY OVER-PRICED!
",0
"Many of the users on here will say very terrible things to the other users that I don't feel that I should say.
",2
"There are some games know as role-playing games where kids and teens and sometimes adults will create characters and will insult other players that do not know the rules or how to play it.
",4
"They will usually call them ""cancerous"" and ""autistic"" and many other awful things to the younger users finding themselves playing these types of games.
",8
"Some users will also scam other users for their special items.
",5
"If I had kids, I would definitely not let them play this game!
",4
"This did more harm than good, because several innocent phrases can be interpreted incorrectly by the filter.
",1
"Bullies & Trolls also reside on this website, so keep that in mind.
",5
"Additionally, it is HIGHLY recommended that you DO NOT spend any money in this game, virtual or real.
",6
"Hackers are known to take accounts and steal, blackmail, or frame their victims.
",4
"Sex games are a uncommon thing on this website but you can't encounter them by accident, and they're usually banned.
",9
"Another issue is that scams come in many forms in this game:
",8
"
",0
"- Comments telling you to visit a website for free stuff
",5
"
",0
"- People saying they will buy you robux and or BC on your account if you give them your password
",7
"
",0
"- Etc.
",0
"I love this game have been playing it for 5 years but now that there are no tickets it is impossible to get robux unless you try to hack or something or unless you pay and that is not fair tickets were a way to get robux  you got 10 everyday you logged on and you could trade them in for robux but now that there are no tickets there is no way to get them unless you pay or hack by the way you buy clothes and items with robux.
",6
"This game is not for you.
",4
"You will hear parents saying LOADS of bull crap.
",2
"And it's completely restricted.
",5
"So dont believe those overprotective.
",4
"Lying parents.
",0
"No bad content like that.
",1
"Whenever, Roblox crashes again.
",6
"It won't let you join again in a million times.
",7
"At times, there can be scams for free ""ROBUX"".
",8
"There are games with adult stuff and minor swearing, but thanks to popularity luck, these games are not getting noticed that much!
",9
"You can also friend people, and they might send you rude messages.
",5
"There are some problems, like the occasional filter loophole that people use a lot in the session.
",1
"When people die in this game, their body parts fall off (not in a gruesome way unless the creator uses certain scripts).
",3
"It's a great concept but there's some issues with this website that parents should be aware of.
",3
"Parents should be aware that the moderation on this website is pretty awful.
",2
"There is some days when a sexually explicit game gets on the front page and it'll take a few days for the game to be taken down by the moderators.
",9
"The community in ROBLOX isn't great either, be prepared to be called out for how your avatar looks or be blatantly insulted for playing a game how it should be played.
",5
"The Games
",0
"Some of the games on ROBLOX are pretty violent and may have blood and gore, which is considered inappropriate for the younger audiences.
",3
"The concept is great, but the community of this game ruins it with violent and pornographic games.
",3
"You may want to consider about letting your child on this site.
",7
"there is one thing that really makes me want to rip my hair out.
",0
"There is a lot of exploiting and bullying in this game.
",9
"so I type my other accounts and they don't work.
",0
"this gets me really frustrated because now I cant share my problems with the creators and give advice.
",9
"FIX THIS NOW.also lots of kids talk about sex in this game so beware.
",8
"They don't directly help this issue.
",9
"ODers frolick around without Roblox caring.
",6
"Honestly this could effect your child's safety if they were to do this and talk to an older person who gets them to use a site outside of roblox.
",7
"DO NOT ONLINE DATE KIDS.
",0
"Roblox does moderate the chat, too much especially for kids under 13.
",8
"They can  say things like 'Bish' instead of the actual word or WTF instead of the actual sentence.
",1
"In all honesty it is a block body character.
",2
"When they die, they fall apart and a sound is made.
",3
"But you don't usually see blood, if you do it isn't realistic or anything.
",7
"Of course there are games where you have to kill people, but it isn't realistic.
",3
"- ON THE TOPIC OF HATE -
",0
"There is a lot of hate on roblox.
",2
"People can say a lot of mean things and it's really sad to watch.
",1
"People will make fun of you for your grammar, to who you look, to your join date, to any little thing they can pick at.
",7
"The only thing I hate is the amount of paid stuff!
",2
"9 and below should avoid them.
",7
"Online Dating is biggest thing wrong in Roblox so tell your child not to talk.
",7
"however they may be some downs due to the expensive items.
",8
"Some of these items are actually used for the very known problem: Online dating.
",6
"But another problem is hacki- excuse me I meant EXPLOITING and scams.
",0
"Another type of scam would be site scamming, someone would trick someone into logging on into there own fake roblox site into getting the account, and there are many more types of scams.
",5
"Exploiting; yes, the horrid name for ""hacking"" in roblox.
",1
"Roblox has infact got there site exploited before and one example is the 2012 April Fools hacking, but probably fake.
",0
"Aand another bonus: Many people on the so called site: V3rmillion have cracked passwords from OBC roblox accounts and sell them, and it includes other users too, so i'm putting in a safety and privacy concern.
",8
"I bet you that half of these people who say Roblox is bad are just parents who just played one roblox game made by a noob  for 1 second and when they just see one naked person they say "" THIS GAME IS PORN AHHHH!!!""
",0
"Gosh you can't control how a person looks.
",7
"If your kid was that DUMB ENOUGH to tell your private info.
",7
"You would have to take them to a doctor.
",7
"I saw on this website that someone said they were called a troll.
",0
"A troll is someone who acts dumb so they could get attention.
",7
"Bullying.
",0
"Half of the time your kid  gets bullied on roblox is just because he is being a jerk to other people and people don't like him.
",5
"Or he is doing something REALLY dumb.
",0
"I would expect you parents to be more thoughtful about the world we are living in right now.
",4
"Because PEOPLE are NOT perfect.
",2
"hope I'm not the only person complaining about this
",2
"I been playing roblox for a long time and some of the updates ruined its reputation, as scammers appear more often.
",9
"Roblox has a high consumerism problem.
",8
"but even worse when you don't get free daily robux (Money on roblox)
",6
"
",0
"But if your like me and bypass it, hopefully you can have a good experience.
",3
"Since 2011, I have watched the community get worse and worse.
",5
"People are rude and though they have a ""filtered"" chat, swear words still get through, (s.3.x, f.v.c.k, etc.)
",1
"As I said in the title, a game that the players create sounds like a good idea, but without heavy moderation, turns out to be a crap chute.
",3
"Downgraded in quality.
",1
"Unless you get Builders Club (paid membership) since they took away tix, there is practically no way to get robux.

"Completely unbalanced mess of an ecosystem.

"There are ads everywhere, and so many features are limited to members of the wildly expensive ""builders club.""

"As a product of consumerism (pun intended), there are massive amounts of dishonorable players.

"These players buy (or have their parents buy) in game weapons, or other tools and abilities, and then unfairly exploit them.

"Also there is dating and junk roleplaying games which could include some bad stuff if your child is mature enough go for it but he/she can say stuff that can get them banned so talk with them about it.

"Also there is some violence such as bombs, guns, possibly blood and gore.

"There is also ALOT of swearing and scams out there for in game currency called rubux.

"They also took away the tix currency, which made 1/2 of trade and conversion pointless.

"The Easter Egg Hunts rarely have participants, and the eggs dont even hatch anymore.

"What I find stupid is how much money it is to join Buildersclub.

"They keep on discouraging and discouraging people who are not members in order to get money, even though they already have more than enough.
",8
"My huge problem here is the personal servers deletion, because I build better in those.
",8
"I am not gonna consider problems from the players, because they don't relate to the staff at all.
",6
"I am not asking for the game to become like the 2006-2008 edition, because considering that many things great occured there, there was also a lot of lag and bugs.

"Many scripts have been broken.

"WHY YOU SHOULDN'T PLAY ROBLOX:
",0
"Too many teenagers.
",1
"To speak with these teens, you have to lie about your age.
",7
"There's a few games, but not many, that have blood, etc.
",3
"You can even say BAD WORDS by removing a few letters, or simply adding symbols,  for example: ""sht"".
",1
"Bullies.
",0
"There are so many bullies.
",1
"I have been picked on because of ROBLOX.
",8
"Please, pretty please, do not let your child, or if you're a kid/teen, yourself, play this game.
",7
"It is simply horrible.
",2
"One thing I can tell you right away is that the community is far from friendly,  and it can be somewhat difficult to make friends due to the overall harshness and prejudice of the general player base.
",0
"Aside from the players, the game does suffer from major flaws.
",9
"A few being poor moderation, over consumerism and hackers slash exploiters.
",8
"The moderation of this site isn't optimal, but it's sufficient enough to where your child is not exposed to nudity or anything along those lines, but people may use methods to bypass the weak filter currently in game, which means your child is often going to encounter swearing and harsh language, since rude behavior is hardly regulated.
",1
"There's also another ongoing problem aside from the community, and that is the game constantly trying to get you to purchase something.
",6
"Even customizing your character will cost you money.
",9
"Hackers and exploiters also pose a threat to your child.
",5
"They will most likely ruin their experience due to all of the hackers breaking and screwing with the game.
",9
"The game is'nt really for kids because some players still make porn on roblox there's volience .We do drugs on roblox if you don't belive because i do it on roblox we made a secret game so.And the safe is not really safe.It's annoing like we don't even swear it's still putshashtags?And some people who pla the game are super mean ,annoing and stupid.
",8
"This game has inappropriate content on games, the roblox co. bans these game as well but A REALLY BIG RISK!
",2
"There's swearing as well but if it is a child account, it will block the swearing.
",1
"Recommended not getting roblox for your child.
",7
"ROBLOX is full of things that are good and bad for kids.
",2
"There safe-chat system kind of works but sometimes it'll block out perfectly fine words.
",1
"Then that person was caling me a noob and stupid.
",9
"They said ""I am leaving stupid girl and don't follow me"".
",0
"I then cried..... Althought you can report them I feel like it never works.
",7
"Therefore parents, you have to tell your children to not chat because not even the safe chat works.
",7
"First of all, The Item in Roblox Are very expensive, There are online dater and dating games, and that only the problem.
",3
"There No ""S.E.X games"", People who made that will be remove or ban for life, and of course there ""violent"" but it not really bad.
",1
"this game, is so laggy and doesn't work, I have deleted the app and tried to download it again which also doesn't work.
",6
"I find it a waste of my time, why play a game when it takes 30 seconds to just look in the other direction!
",0
"There are players on there (""Trolls"") who's main reason for being online is to ruin the fun and enjoyment of other players.
",6
"Reviews have claimed that the Staff of ROBLOX (""Moderators"") don't pay attention to these reports, and when they look at them.
",4
"They don't do anything, I understand the irritation.
",4
"Another problem with players is the online role-playing and dating.
",1
"While it is against the rules of ROBLOX, these are Children most cases.
",2
"They try and cheat the system, using words that the computer doesn't recognize as dating phrases, this also goes along with swearing.
",1
"Kids attempt to cheat the system, using words like: (Excuse my profanity) ""Fk u"", which is derived from ""Fuck you"", ""Sht"" for ""Shit"".
",1
"They're more difficult to get rid of, but I don't think they're the main problem.
",6
"3, Violence: As a Parent, your last expectation from a ""Kids"" game is to see gross and graphic violence, those sorts of actions are more fit for an ""Adult"" game.
",2
"But some of the games on ROBLOX have Violence, whether by Guns, Bombs, Swords, etc.
",3
"Roblox is a hard game to choose an age rating since in depends on the game but i will say 13+ because some games are rude and violent and a lot of the strangers in the chat swea
",2
"well when my friend showed me i got hooked but then we figured out people could make viruses there... so i stopped ROBLOX i might play it sometimes at my friends house but i did not make them download it
",0
"Super safe chat should be for those 15 and under because they aren't ready for Rated-R movies and people say stuff like ""what the h**l"", ""sh*t"", ""d*mn"", and ""p*ss"" uncensored!
",4
"There could be violence which could be unsuitable for those under 10.
",1
"I started playing when I was 9 years old and it was pretty violent.
",0
"Kids 10-15 can handle violence and language but can't handle sex so STOP MAKING SEX because people go like ""Let's go out"" and ""123 for a hot bf/gf"".
",3
"You kids under 10 reading this, DON'T GO ON ROBLOX because there is too much violence, swearing, and a bit of sex!
",2
"The game is overly materialistic and poorly moderated.
",5
"Unless you have some superior internet, you ain't making much use of this game.
",7
"Roblox staff claim they do not support bullying.
",6
"There is so many stupid items in the catalog against ""noobs"".
",4
"No wonder a poor noob can't make friends!
",9
"Other kids will see that stuff, think they are doing the right thing, and start bullying ""noobs""!
",7
"If Roblox really is against bullying, they will do anything to avoid it, and making rude content will only increase the chances of bullying!
",2
"Sorry, Roblox staff.
",0
"You only care about your own benefit.
",7
"I love this game deeply, but it has it's drawbacks.
",3
"You can report, but the moderators don't care.
",2
"6) cussing can get through chat logs, but not very easily.
",1
"7) it is okay for younger kids, but it can be violent
",3
"Firstly, let me say that you parents are VERY mislead and they don't include ROBLOX Studio.

"Only thing to tell you is to ignore them.
",7
"Don't chat to them unless you really need to (Please don't try to ""call them out,"" most of them are trolls who want to have fun by making people mad.)

"If they can't pay for all of that, ROBLOX would not be able to survive.

"If you think BC is expensive then don't buy it.

"If your kid has Builder's Club, then they are at greater risk, because those scammers can look at the billing info and use your credit card number for yourself.

"This game does have inappropriate people I won't lie about that, but when you think realistically you're going to end up running into inappropriate people every where.
",8
"Kid's are swearing and online dating, but that's just kids of course they're going to act like little brats and do silly things.
",3
"When I saw some of the parent reviews saying it was extremely violent, and had inappropriate games/users, it really annoyed me.
",0
"This one I do agree on with other parents, moderation isn't the best.
",2
"In fact, reporting people literally does nothing.
",2
"On the other hand though, you rarely see sexual games, and violence can only get so extreme.
",2
"There isn't many ways to make this game gruesome.
",1
"Like I said, there are games and people who aren't so nice.

"I personally believe that Roblox isn't as bad as all these parents who're complaining believe it to be.
",2
"Yeah, I get people can be pretty inappropriate at times, but what site //doesn't\\ have flaws?
",2
"The report systems don't work because Roblox doesn't have enough time to pick out what every individual person needs, so only the more serious reports get answered, scamming, death threats, etc.
",6
"And cyberbullying is a problem on every site.
",2
"As a player who has played for this amount of time, I am heartbroken to see what the game has become.
",0
"Scamming and spam is comparable to what it was before, however it is still an issue.
",3
"In many games now, inappropriate language and uncouth behaviour runs rampant.
",4
"I would advise anyone not seeking to experience bad language to avoid games which are inherently designed for communicating and not to achieve something (ie games which are like 'clubs', 'hangouts', 'high schools', etc).
",9
"In one recent game of mine, I walked into an area in a club wearing an outfit that is dated now, due to the fact that it was made in 2009 and immediately I was insulted with very offensive racial slurs (despite not being the race whereof they insulted).

"I end up reporting at least five times a day; not for minor infractions but for extremely harsh language.
",8
"This huge gap between about 3 years and 1 day of waiting results in a caste system whereby non-members can only afford basic items.

"Roblox has been effective at combating hacking, however it happens a lot in very old places because they can be exploited easily.

"The worst hacks I have seen have involved extremely adult content, however this last happened a year ago if not more.

"Spam messages from female account bots with usernames such as ""jaimeaustin481"" will provide a link within their messages, which will lead to one's account being compromised if one should follow the link.
",5
"This is less than what it was years ago, when some games would incorporate 'blood' and hackers would hack in a 'slit throat', which has been patched.

"Overall, I would say that the game has too much swearing and consumerism and that it is quite easy to lose one's account should one click a bad link sent to them by a bot.

"There are way too many examples of in-game items or features being massively expensive to list - the site is mostly just a cash grab.
",8
"Note that the game does not give many advanced tutorials with this - there are tutorials, though, but me and my friends found these fairly difficult to follow - your mileage may vary - and the few in-depth tutorials are created by users who themselves have a good understanding of the language.

"I asked customer support to help change my email, but they didn't know what to do.

"Most games are violent and/or horror games.
",3
"First of all, I should update you on this outdated review.
",5
"Roblox has now many polished games, but they have become much more violent.
",9
"There are realistic FPS's and super scary games.
",8
"Roblox had an entire contest to find the scariest game that developers could make, and sure they surely got what they wanted.
",7
"In Roblox's community guidelines, it does not clearly state how violent/scary games can get, so you should monitor your kids when playing.
",7
"Games cannot ask for your password, depict real disasters or violent moments (For example, Roblox said no Nazi's), or inappropriate media on their homepage.
",5
"If it has any of this, once it the game is reported, it should be pulled.
",2
"Because of they cluttered place though, it is usually a rough start.
",7
"The last thing I want to review is the moderation of chat.
",2
"It evolves with abbreviations so swear words should be removed.
",1
"The problem exists though in self-made chat systems though.
",8
"They usually use the blacklist system made by the developers, where the moderation of chat is horrible.
",1
"You can only report a user once for swearing, which makes the game very iffy.
",2
"The community itself is terrible the mature and intelligent community on the website are outnumbered 5/1 by the rude community.
",6
"i joined in 2011 i can tell you that the community is just terrible and i would recommend it to little children if it wasn't for this exact reason.
",5
"There is also a huge amount of racist people being Jewish myself im not treated very well on the website there is a abundance of National Socialist based groups (groups are little nations or war clans even fan clubs people can join) these NS groups are very rude to people going as far as cyber bulling.
",3
"People will now be like, "" I don't like your hats so I'll cuss at you.
",7
"Unless you have hats, shirts, and pants, people will criticize for your looks, not your skill.
",5
"Used to play this all the time, but now I'm like, people are rude.
",2
"People will also swear at you.
",1
"However, you should know that the game page is sometimes loaded with games that have negative concepts.
",8
"""The Mad Murderer"" is an example of these.

"There are also war groups, and... many games where people die, in general.
",8
"BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN ALL GAMES ARE BAD.

"Nowadays, when you sign up for ROBLOX, based on your gender you are automatically given a terrible looking lego-like figure.
",9
"Please remove this immediately.
",6
"Most users discriminate against it and it is only ever used ironically.
",2
"They only do this because of the poor hashtag sensor system.
",6
"If we all report the swearing people, we can prevent swearing altogether.
",1
"Besides, they're all probably spoiled 6-year-olds who play Call of Duty, anyways.
",9
"Be warned that admin reports are poor.
",2
"If you report a user, you better have a good, well-thought out reason that anybody can understand, or you yourself will be misunderstood, and banned for a couple of weeks.
",7
"PLEASE BE AWARE, ABOUT BATTLE GAMES, I think they're only accepted because all players re-appear at a checkpoint if they die.
",3
"Off Topic is full of ""Trolls"", and All Things ROBLOX is almost never on topic.
",2
"Builder's Club isn't cheap, either.
",0
"Before you discriminate against this, how much money do YOU think it cost to run a website with THOUSANDS of users who log in every day?
",2
"They removed the safe-chat feature, so now users who sign up under 13 can't say anything unless a parent sets it so they can, which is hard to figure out how to do.
",6
"If you're worried about your kid doing bad things or playing bad games or wondering if they're getting their feelings hurt, or whatever you're wondering, just make your own account and follow them around secretly.
",5
"ROBLOX is the place to go if you want to spend hundreds of dollars just to get your feelings hurt.
",7
"Dont play this game this game use to be fun until builderman decided to ruin it by removing robux from regular members and only giving it to the builder club members really builderman?This isn't fair you need to let regular members have robux not just bc members.This game will be closed soon if you builderman don't give more access for regular members to have.

"Anyways, you will occasionally bump into something and many games are violent from the community.

"I'd suggest anyone 11 and under avoid the forums, as they are easy to get hooked on (I have about 8,000 posts myself) and you can get into a lot of trouble easily.

"-Some accounts can be compromised if you have an easy password
",5
"-Some people create sexual games, but they are never on the site for more than 10 minutes before the place is shutdown and the user is IP banned that made that game.

"People swear, and there is a massive amount of bullying and other inappropriate things, on top of that to make matters worse the customer service is terrible.

"The 'report abuse' option is basically pointless because I've reported the same person over 5 times for threatening my sister for multiple things and there is still nothing happening.
",0
"Also, I sent multiple emails complaining about there lack of caring & good service.
",0
"My advice to you would be this; don't let your child play this game.
",7
"It's a overall fun game, but it was originally for children under the age of 12 and is now full of a bunch of immature careless teenagers.
",4
"Without BC, well you're screwed pretty much.
",7
"Moderators: the mods can be a bit iffy in places.

"Only problem was, back in that time, I had a very slow PC.

"When I installed it, my PC nearly crashed and it was very difficult to do anything on it.

"Roblox updates A LOT too, so just don't play with Roblox with some old desktop that's already pretty slow.

"By the way, the most annoying things on it aren't that big of a deal.
",8
"The violence is EXTREMELY low.
",3
"Your character literally just falls into pieces of bricks (because this is roblox, sorta like LEGO).

"I rate the education pretty low, because, as for myself, I have never really done anything about making a game.

"I tried once, found it pretty boring, and just played more games.

"The ads are annoying though, but my computer never has told me that it has viruses of any kind, and if that isn't enough, just don't click the ads if you still think they have danger.

"Something that really ticks me off though, are the moderators.

"As a user, I honestly think that Roblox let's things slide to often, then end up banning you because they think you lied about reporting something.

"I know there area a lot of bad reviews for this game.
",2
"If you are overprotective and don't want your kids playing the unrealistic violent games, you can just tell them not to.
",7
"But a lot of people on Roblox create games that aren't appropriate for kids to play, such as ""Call of Robloxia 5"" or whatever, which is a ""Call of Duty"" rip off.
",8
"Roblox itself didn't make these games because Roblox is a website where you create a free account and you can make your own games for other users to enjoy, but since the account is free they try and sell you different memberships that can earn you things that are useless and are dumb.

"Also since most of the games posted that users can play aren't made by Roblox controlled accounts they can get pretty violent.

"Roblox says that their website is made for kids but it really isn't.

"My account got banned by a Roblox user who dosen't exist.

"My account was banned because my username was ""inappropriate"".

"The community is childish, almost EVERYONE (including me) has no life because of Roblox, anyone can call anyone a noob, and speaking of that, ALMOST everyone hates Guests and tries to communicate with them (even though Guests can only see Menu Chats), again speaking, Guests seem to do more destruction than any regular Roblox Member, and it seems that Guests can't get banned from Roblox, allowing them to use Hacks and have fun and NEVER get banned.

"The main problems are many games are violent (killing with knives, every kind of gun imaginable, and military vehicles) but violence is cartoon ish and most games do not contain blood.

"The high ranks profit off their desperation, or ignorance, by monetizing group items such as gamepasses or uniforms.

"One of ROBLOX's main focuses is creativity, but strict rules, membership segregation, uniforms, and limitation of speech is extremely hypocritical and counterproductive.
",3
"I say hypocritical because ROBLOX has nodded towards the existence of wargroups and their rules, sugar coated the situation, and ignored all of the flaws that have been presented.
",6
"They ignore such flaws because they know that this binds people to the game.

"Many players including myself can not deal with a completely new player, as you can not tell them how to play or even to stop.

"Though one can get a good learning experience from building their own games, there are numerous flaws in this MMO, supposedly oriented at kids 8-14.

"overall its a bad site crammed with tv and internet stuff/memes/show spoof!
",2
"DONT PLAY IT!
",0
"but games can be violent.
",3
"The biggest issue on Roblox is the lazy moderation, and their obvious advertisment for premium membership (Builders Club).
",6
"You can report another player and be the one punished in the end.
",9
"People use the lack of moderation to say just about anything (I've seen players tell each other ""go die/ kill yourself"" just because they did not like the game they were in).
",1
"Games can be scripted to include explicit content, alcohol, and cigars, and blood that shoots out when your player dies like in M rated games.
",3
"Bullyng can also be a problem.
",1
"If players get into an argument, they can spit out whatever profanities they can think of, and will often just use whatever lousy argument they can think of (whether it makes sense or not).
",1
"A common practice is to call other players ""noob"" as an insult without actual reason.
",6
"The places in roblox can use all these scripts and weapons and whatever they find to make inapropriate palces (I've been in a place called ""Beware the Hot Chick"" that involved your character being raped and killed.
",6
"I reported it and it was still up a week later).
",0
"Some games are meant just to scare other palyers with disturbing images.
",8
"Another problem is a game called ""What am I Drawing"" that was popular, where the player drew an image and other players guessed what it was for points.
",0
"Players could draw ANYTHING they wanted, and there was no way to report them because when you report someone, moderators only check the chat (what was said) if they check at all.
",6
"Don't buy Builders Club.
",6
"If someone hacks into your childs account (which is common on roblox) they do whatever they want with your credit card.
",7
"CONCLUSION: Roblox is a dangerous site.
",2
"It is not the site itself, but the fact that users have to much freedom and there are to few moderators.
",1
"VIOLENCE: Weapons such as guns, bombs, dynamite, swords, and fists.
",1
"Also when you die, a flash of blood appears on the edge of the screen for half a second.
",1
"LANGUAGE: There is Safe Chat, but with Open Chat you can say whatever you want, including foul language, but players know they will get banned for using foul language.
",1
"Roblox censors out swearing, and people who bypass the filters get punished.
",1
"There are games out there relating to WWII and combat; however if you're a parent who is a pacifist or doesn't want your children exposed to that, you can simply not go to that game.
",7
"For sexual content, I have no idea why these people are saying that it's an issue.
",2
"Sexual content is censored and whoever makes sexual references in any way, shape, or form receives a huge consequence.
",1
"So, if you ask me, the website is great, however there are some things a few parents I know will not tolerate.
",3
"If you make an account for your child that is 12 and under,make sure that his/her account is super safe chat (can only chat with a menu),by entering an age of 12 or under,because the community is horrible.A lot of people say bad words,and some people do ""online dating"".
",5
"There are a FEW games that are violent, so watch your kids.
",7
"The community is great  The bad thing is that the playerbase ALSO has many trolls, spammers, and inexperied users.
",3
"Not really a good game.
",2
"If your a parent or kid or tween that usually plays game with a Good Fanbase and Community, this game is not for you, it has possibly the worse community that I ever saw in a game by far!
",5
"I got called F*** you more than 5 times!
",6
"Sometime's people won't even help you!
",1
"The community is probably the 2nd major reason why Roblox is not a good game for under 9.
",6
"Yikes!
",0
"I'm keep seeing that people saying that the violence is bad and weapons are Rocket's, Bomb's, Ball's, Paintguns, and Slingshots?
",3
"Pff, I seen a game with bloody stuff and zombies from Left 4 Dead and it's on for more 2 years old and the player is not banned!
",3
"Well, the game is down.
",2
"But you could if they say F***.
",7
"Also, if you post anything that's off topic like links, you will get a warning or get banned.

"This is what I think about this game: Corruption.
",2
"I mean, this games teaches kids to buy expensive stuff such as Builders Club to be better than other ones.
",4
"I saw once a bunch of kids telling another one to shut up just because he didn't buy Builders Club!

"They don't have a censered naming system and chat, but they do NOT alow bad usernames and words.

"There is moral issues such as false advertisement, mainly of tycoons.
",6
"People may ignore your questions and call you a noob.
",7
"But most of the bad stuff is caused by the community, not the company.
",1
"So no I will not accept random friend request.
",7
"However, users can do inappropriate things without a parent knowing.
",7
"Such as Dating, Minor violence and very small drug problems (Smoking, Beer, etc).
",9
"Which should not be found in a child's game.
",1
"Besides, Roblox's morderators are horrible at removing the player that is causing the player.
",5
"But ROBLOX is not the best Online-Building game.
",3
"This game isn't recommended.
",0
"If someone says something mean or against the rules, don't hesitate to report them.
",7
"Some, like Dude's Pizza Place everyone has to do their job or the pizzas don't get delivered and the manager actually does something.
",4
"However, the chat system is not filtered, and a character must report someone for breaking the rules.
",1
"ROBLOX has a lot of moderators, and if somebody breaks the rules the moderators will give them a warning if it is their first time breaking a rule, and then ban them if they continue their bad behavior.
",7
"The site allows safe chat so players 12+ or 13+ can use words that are not with bad content such as F*#k and C@*t but players have a way to get away with it so players under 13 can't hear it if they call them stupid.
",1
"There is some bad stuff like swearing but they have monitors online that patrol the games that people create.
",6
"The levels are user generated, and the moderation is extremely poor.
",2
"You see blood on the walls and the floors, dead block people, horror movie characters, and you can use guns on some games.
",3
"There also might be poop on some games.
",0
"The players might cuss (but I doubt they get away with it), there's    also an option to report others and flag games as inappropriate.
",3
"Making games is super hard and long.
",8
"The game has issues a lot (not loading everything, loading slowly, even stops loading).
",6
"I'm not allowed to play it anymore though, because of what my parents thought of the appropriateness.
