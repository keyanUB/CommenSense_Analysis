       "\"I've been playing roblox since I was 9 roblox was slightly disgusting than with people and now its even more fucking disgusting as I'm older and especially with voice chat. on top of that people will get you banned for 0 reason and roblox doesn't respond at least this has happened for me. I even show them proof as if they would fucking care to look. the game has become trash in that aspect and games nowadays are getting more boring. It's really getting worthless to play this game anymore. I'm 18 now and a lot of people on roblox is not safe for children even when I was little but now its worse. Some people be talking shit like sex and etc without getting banned this is how bad it is in my view. I would like to rant more but this is some.\""
